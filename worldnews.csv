1,t3_eclwg9,Trump Impeached for Abuse of Power,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/18/us/politics/trump-impeachment-vote.html,MachoNachoTaco,nytimes.com,2019-12-18 17:23:35,20128,202902,582,UPDATE: vote on impeachment for Obstruction of Congress has also passed.,25991,Friendly reminder to vote in the next election and in every election.,20400,"Okay for everyone wondering what impeachment is vs a removal of office.

Impeachment is like charging you with a crime. So the House of Representatives charged Trump with abuse of power & obstruction of congress.

Removal of office comes about when the House of Representatives vote by a majority to impeach on each charge (known as an Article of Impeachment), that goes to the Senate, and then by a 2/3 majority (67 Senators) in the Senate to vote to convict, and only then is the President is finally removed from office.

In other words, impeachment is like being charged by the DA for manslaughter, removal of office is when the jury decides you're guilty of manslaughter. The DA is the House, and the jury is the Senate in this analogy.

EDIT: Instead of giving me gold (just DM me your potatoes), please take the time to check that you're registered to [vote](https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/) and consider donating to the ACLU or [Fair Fight 2020](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vsafairfight), an organization ran by Stacey Abrams (GA 2018 Gov nominee) that protects the right to vote. Fair Fight 2020 specifically focuses on fighting against voter purges.

EDIT 2:

I keep getting asked whether or not a President that has been impeached and removed from office can hold office again. He cannot if the Senate votes as to do as such specifically (source 3)

Over 100 news agencies sitting in 100 contries all over the world are disclosing the panama papers tonight at the exact same time. This will be a huge hit for several large figures in world sports, politics and economy. Names like Lionel messi, Vladimir Putin and the prime minister of Iceland are already leaked. I am curious to see who turns up as well. What a leak!! All coordinated by German newspaper namely the Sueddeutsche Zeitung. As op linked to

Before reading further: 
Here is a nice ELI5 of shell company procedures and how they work written by /u/Jaredlong:

>Taxes sure do suck, right? Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didn't pay them. Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to ncrease spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can ""spend"" that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden.

*pls note that this is a subjective ELI5 and there are indeed some reasons/scenarios where shell companies operate for legit reasons! (thanks /u/Toppo) [orig. comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4d75i7/26_terabyte_leak_of_panamanian_shell_company_data/d1og7kz)*

Edit: 'Die Zeit' another big German newspaper writes that about 200k  letterbox companies (in total 11.5 million records) are disclosed... Jesus what is going on. This will be big news for the next few weeks (hopefully longer than that!)

Edit2: the icij had released a YouTube video [here:](https://youtu.be/F6XnH_OnpO0) which sums up what is in those documents. (Even if someone is speaking in the video very calm there is really disturbing stuff in there like people trafficking and sex slavery etc...)

Edit3: [here](https://panamapapers.icij.org/graphs)  are some graphs generated from the data showing it goes back to the 80s. The official site is very informative and what is in there. I guess they will also have them for download somewhere...

big hands to /u/AsshatVik composing the list of head of states (as /u/kaisermatias said, most of the names on the list are head of governments not head of states...):
    
    The 12 heads of state are:

    Mauricio Macri, president or Argentina.

    Bidzina Ivanishvill. ex PM of Georgia

    Sigmundur something something, PM of Iceland.

    Ayad H. Allawi, ex PM of Iraq.

    Ali Abu-Ragheb, ex PM of Jordan.

    Hamad Jasim J.M. Al-Thani, ex PM of Qatar.

    Sheik Al-Thani, Emir of Qatar.

    HRH Prince Salman, King of Saudi Arabia

    Ahmad Al-Nirghani, ex-president of Sudan

    Sultan Al-Nahyan, president of the UAE.

    Pavlo Lazarenko, ex-PM of Ukraine.

    Petro Poroshenko, president of Ukraine.

    Update of /u/AsshatVik

    Mohammed VI of Morocco might also be involved. Mossack Fonseca created the company to which his personal yatch is registered.


    Family members of Ilham Aliyev, president of Azerbajan also used Fonseca to manage mining and real estate investments.
     

    8 High echelon communist party members of People's Republic of China also used their services. Xi Jinping is amongst them, who's linked to two businesses in the British Virgin Islands.





edit 5:

edit 6: **For all germans**. There are germans on the list. No politicians (or other high stake figures) but new evidence on the siemens scandal (from the top of my head I don't know which he was referring to..;D) for example. Mossak Fonseca is helping germans massively in the act of tax evasion.  There is not a single german bank not on the list except ""Sparkasse"" etc... (those who are more or less government affiliated) **for non germans** not all names are already leaked since the journalists give those on the list the opportunity to comment on the accusation.

Due to its size, health and age diversity — with sequoias ranging from seedlings to Methuselahs — this grove represents ""the most consequential giant sequoia conservation project of our lifetime,"" according to the group's president.

Known as Alder Creek, the grove covers a seemingly modest 530 acres (2 square kilometers), but that's a big deal for giant sequoias. The iconic trees once lived throughout the Northern Hemisphere, but they now exist in only 73 isolated groves, all located on the western slopes of California's Sierra Nevada mountains. This particular grove packs a lot into its 530 acres, including 483 sequoias with trunks at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter, along with a few hundred smaller sequoias of varying ages.

That age range is a big reason why this grove is so valuable, according to Sam Hodder, president and CEO of Save the Redwoods League (SRL), a century-old California nonprofit that's been working to acquire Alder Creek for more than 20 years.

**""Many giant sequoia groves are just a single age class, usually in the thousands,"" Hodder told MNN when the deal was announced in September 2019. ""In this one, a real indication of its health and resilience is that there are giant sequoia of all age ranges."" While any remaining giant sequoia grove is a rarity, he adds, ""it's rarer still to have multiple age classes, and such a healthy forest ecosystem.""**

SRL signed a purchase agreement with the Rouch family, which has owned the grove since the 1940s. That was a big step after two decades, but the sale wasn't official — until now. There was the small matter of $15.65 million, which SRL had to raise by Dec. 31 before it could take ownership. The group did that with a public fundraising drive on its website that rallied for help right up to the deadline. Donations rolled in from more than 8,500 donors from all 50 states and around the world.


Alder Creek is an island of private property surrounded by Giant Sequoia National Monument, which spans about 328,000 acres (1,327 square km) and connects to the even larger Sequoia National Forest. The Rouch family has long used the grove for commercial logging, Hodder says, and even cut down giant sequoias in the early days, although since the 1960s they've reportedly only logged non-sequoia species like sugar pine and white fir. SRL plans to eventually transfer ownership to the U.S. Forest Service, so the sequoias can join the federally protected wilderness around them.

That won't happen for a while, though, since SRL expects to hold the property for five to 10 years. That's partly because this kind of public-acquisition process moves slowly, Hodder says, but also because SRL wants time to study the grove and implement a plan for good stewardship, making sure the trees are healthy and ready before handing them over to the public.

As part of that preparation, the group plans to open Alder Creek for public access even before giving it to the Forest Service, hoping to help the ecosystem ease into an unfamiliar role as a host for human visitors. ""This property has been in private ownership, and it has never had public access,"" Hodder says. ""We want to go through a thoughtful process to plan out public access, so when it does get conveyed into the national monument, it's ready for its public purpose."""" - article excerpt",3140,[removed],2715,0.0,0.928,0.072,0.5267,pos

""The combination of money and addiction is gambling"", ruled the gambling committee. VTM News brought the news and a few days later EA withdrew the function from the game, partially because Disney complained, which has the rights to the Star Wars merchandise.

Additionally, I don't write this to be a defeatist, but rather to draw attention to our very real problems: 

Climate change and the degradation of the natural world are going to be **humanity's existential crisis**

[If we stopped all emissions today, the planet would warm for at LEAST a century, and very likely closer to scales of millenia](http://theconversation.com/if-we-stopped-emitting-greenhouse-gases-right-now-would-we-stop-climate-change-78882). CO2 lasts for hundreds of years in the atmosphere, and then only goes into other forms of the carbon cycle slowly over thousands of years (or never).  

Firstly, there is a [delay in air temperature increase.](https://skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html) This means that the carbon already emitted will take 40 years to reach its full potential. This is largely due to the slow process of Earth's oceans warming. In many ways, we're feeling the emissions of the 80's right now.  

There are feedback loops. As the planet warms, the oceans cannot absorb as much CO2. [Methane](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-bad-of-a-greenhouse-gas-is-methane/), which works on scales of hundreds of years instead of thousands(but is much more effective at heating), will be released more and more on large swaths of land as time goes on. 

Other feedback loops include deforestation and albedo effects, [melting ice caps](https://nas-sites.org/americasclimatechoices/more-resources-on-climate-change/climate-change-lines-of-evidence-booklet/evidence-impacts-and-choices-figure-gallery/figure-9/), and [increasing water vapor](https://phys.org/news/2014-07-vapor-global-amplifier.html) which will only amplify the damage that has already been done.

Think about that: If we did the impossible and switched entirely to 100%, zero-emission, fictional renewables today and provided zero carbon footprint... We'd *still be in dire conditions for generations to come.*

From a wildlife standpoint - even more grim news.
Every animal on the planet is dropping.  [Recent studies](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37775622) estimate 58% of all wildlife has died since 1970. The U.N. has warned [1 million species are at risk of extinction](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/05/ipbes-un-biodiversity-report-warns-one-million-species-at-risk/).  We are in an extinction event that is [*ten to one-hundred times*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction) the rate of any other extinction on Earth, save the giant impact event.  It seems like hyperbole, but it isn't.  We are currently undergoing (at least) the second-fastest extinction in the planet's history.

In all likelihood, poorer areas will have their cost further subsidized down to free or nearly-free. Everyone complaining that it ""should be free"" is kinda misreading the point of this statement. They're trying to set the **maximum** price to $3 to prevent shady clinics and middle-men from excessively marking-up vaccine prices when the vaccines become available. $3 is not the actual price that people will pay in impoverished areas. It's the maximum amount.

Why is this important? They need to get the word out that the price cap is $3 so that, by the time in January or whenever the vaccine is available, the general public will be aware that the price is supposed to be under $3. This will help against markups and the oncoming flood of black market vaccine sellers.

It's smart to set an early, easily-remembered cap price on vaccines and broadly publicize it so that people can tell when they're being ripped off. It also has the side-benefit of psychologically anchoring people to the idea of a $3 vaccine in countries that aren't impoverished. The Gates Foundation and Serum Institute can drive down the price of different vaccines in the US and elsewhere just by popularizing the idea of $3 vaccines to the world.

It's a good, catchy idea: 3 dollar vaccines.

Overdue.,6935,"So, there are questions in this thread and in others about why this genocide was recognized so late and why other similar genocides have yet to be recognized by the United States. As a lawyer working in international law, I wrote what I hope to be at least a partial answer. Unfortunately, the history is fairly complicated and generally poorly explained by news articles. **TL;DR**: The answer is two-fold, and explains why all countries are hesitant to declare certain actions genocide even within countries otherwise unimportant to their foreign policy. First, a declaration of genocide obliges the declarant to act to stop the genocide. Second, and most remarkable in the current case, the declaration forever helps define what the declaring country considers genocide.


In any case, and for the record, this declaration reflects the settled legal reality that this genocide absolutely and legally was a genocide.


***First: The Erga Omnes Obligation***


To understand the first prong, it is necessary to understand the legal concept of *erga omnes*. An *erga omnes* obligation is an obligation that all countries owe to each other and to the world, and is a label generally ascribed to the most important obligations (called *jus cogens*) which the prevention of genocide is. It gives any country in the world standing in an international court when a violation of an *erga omnes* obligation occurs and another country does not stop it. It therefore gives all states the rights to invoke state responsibility for the other country’s failure to contain the genocide (very basically, state responsibility is similar to paying damages, *see* the ILC’s report on state responsibility, linked below). This means that states that do not perform their *erga omnes* obligation when it is their universal responsibility to do so open themselves up to claims internationally. *Erga Omnes* obligations were recognized by the International Court of Justice in [*Barcelona Traction*](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/50/050-19700205-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf) at para 33:


> When a State admits into its territory foreign investments or foreign nationals, whether natural or juristic persons, it is bound to extend to them the protection of the law and assumes obligations concerning the treatment to be afforded them. These obligations, however, are neither absolute nor unqualified. In particular, an essential distinction should be drawn between the obligations of a State towards the international community as a whole, and those arising vis-à-vis another State in the field of diplomatic protection. By their very nature the former are the concern of all States. In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection; they are obligations *erga omnes*.


The prevention of genocide as *erga omnes* was recognized by the International Law Commission of the United Nations through it’s [*Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries*](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf) at page 111 where it states:


> essential distinction should be drawn between the obligations of a State towards the international community as a whole, and those arising vis-à-vis another State in the field of diplomatic protection. By their very nature the former are the concern of all States. In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection; they are obligations erga omnes…  At the preliminary objections stage of the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide case, it stated that “the rights and obligations enshrined by the [Genocide] Convention are rights and obligations erga omnes” this finding contributed to its conclusion that its temporal jurisdiction over the claim was not limited to the time after which the parties became bound by the Convention.


The idea that genocide is an obligation *erga omnes* formally brought into law in the 1996 [*Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia*](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/91/091-19960711-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf) PMO decision when the court, through an analysis of the purpose of the *Genocide Convention* found the prevention of genocide to be an obligation *erga omnes*. That said, in paragraph 31, it said something very interesting: 


> ""The origins of the Convention show that it was the intention of the United Nations to condemn and punish genocide as 'a crime under international law' involving a denial of the right of existence of entire human groups, a denial which shocks the conscience of mankind and results in great losses to humanity, and which is contrary to moral law and to the spirit and aims of the United Nations. The first consequence arising from this conception is that the principles underlying the Convention are principles which are recognized by civilized nations as binding on States, even without any conventional obligation. A second consequence is the universal character both of the condemnation of genocide and of the CO-operation required 'in order to liberate mankind from such an odious scourge' (Preamble to the Convention)."" It follows that the rights and obligations enshrined by the Convention are rights and obligations erga omnes. ***The Court notes that the obligation each State thus has to prevent and to punish the crime of genocide is not territorially limited by the Convention.*** [emphasis added]


This was made even more explicit in the [*The Gambia v. Myanmar*](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/178/178-20200123-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf) where the court said at para 41:


> The Court held that these provisions generated “obligations [which] may be defined as ‘obligations erga omnes partes’ in the sense that each State party has an interest in compliance with them in any given case” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (II), p. 449, para. 68). It follows that any State party to the Genocide Convention, and not only a specially affected State, **may invoke the responsibility of another State party with a view to ascertaining the alleged failure to  comply with its obligations erga omnes partes, and to bring that failure to an end.** [emphasis added]


The parts that I have emphasized are a formal recognition that each state has an actual obligation to do something to prevent genocide in the case that an occurrence of e genocide exists, and as it is an *erga omnes* obligation, a state that recognizes a genocide, is in a position to help stop that genocide, but refuses to do so, has breached its *erga omnes* obligations and other states may invoke state responsibility over them for their failure to act. That is one of a few major reasons that states are hesitant to recognize genocides; **they may be bound to act to stop that genocide if they so declare one.**


***Second: the Application of the Genocide Convention***


One of the most important instruments in international law is the [*Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties*](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf). This treaty under Article 31(3)(b) on the general principles of interpretation states: 


> 3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context: (b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation


The [*Genocide Convention*](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf) under Article II states: 


> In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:
> (a) Killing members of the group;
> (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
> (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
> (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
> (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

The essence of these clauses is that the treatment of Genocide under the Genocide Convention compounds in on itself. While genocide is defined, there is not currently a list of actual specific actions undertaken by states that constitute genocide, which would be extremely helpful because according to the article you have to prove that the there was *intent* to destroy the group, which is based on actions and statements (there are many cases that speak to this requirement).


If the global community generally considers something to be genocide, then that thing that it considers genocide will gradually become indicative of the crime of genocide. Thus, countries risk creating legal situation where genocide becomes what they have declared it to be. While that sounds great, it also risks having the crime of genocide become meaningless as countries are willing to declare it whenever they suspect it, and thus gradually bring the net of behaviour that the genocide convention catches wider. The reason that this is a bad thing is that, as mentioned genocide’s *erga omnes* status is extremely serious and obliges states to act. A loose genocide definition actually makes the world *less* stable and makes states *worse* at preventing that genocide as genocide begins to mean less. Again, this comment is **not** meant to defend any country that shrinks away from its responsibilities.


In sum, international law makes the declaration of genocide a lot harder than base concerns about diplomacy (which absolutely still exist) and is actually much more complicated than people realize.",3912,0.262,0.738,0.0,-0.5994,neg

Wish I could post more, but here's a mini primer on the whole situation with some of my insights. For the most part, I've noticed that discussion on Reddit concerning the Wuhan coronavirus seems to be on point, scientifically. Aside from the occasional fear mongering, misinformation, anti-China sentiment, and jokes about Plague Inc, I feel like general knowledge (at least on Reddit) on the epidemic is pretty decent which is always nice to see. There is research done on social media during these disease outbreaks (2009 pandemic) so comments might be used in a study that influences public health policy.

**What do you need to know?**


As of 23:59 Jan 29, there are officially:


**7711** confirmed cases in China across **31** provinces


**5794** suspected cases. **81947**/88693 are under medical observation


**170** deaths and **1370** are severe cases. 162/170 deaths occurred in Hubei province (where Wuhan is). The rest are within various provinces in China


* 17 deaths range from 48-89 years old. **14/17** deaths are of the elderly above 65 years old. Most have pre-existing conditions that seem to predispose to a more severe disease presentation. People who are already sick prior to infection may be more at risk due to decreased immunity. Some of these people had hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. Death was typically the result of severe respiratory failure but includes others like multi-organ failure. Info on some of the remaining deaths is currently unknown

* Healthy people have died

* 124 people **recovered**

**90** exported cases: Thailand (14), Japan (11), Hong Kong/Singapore (10), Taiwan (8), Macao/Australia/Malaysia (7 each), USA/France (5 each), Germany/South Korea/UAE (4 each), Canada (3), Vietnam (2), Nepal/Cambodia/Finland/Sri Lanka (1 each)

#Please refer to the live trackers for the most up-date statistics

**Initial symptoms**

* cough
* fever (pyrexia possible absence in young individuals)
* fatigue, discomfort (malaise), shortness of breath (dyspnea), dizziness, chest tightness, headache, muscle aches, chills, sore throat
* possible atypical presentations in immunosuppressed/elderly

**Treatment**

No cure, care is supportive to relieve symptoms. Drugs and vaccines are being explored

**Some things healthcare professionals are doing + will do**

* Largest quarantine in the history of public health (**~15** cities, combined population ~56 million)
* Diagnostic testing: Molecular diagnostics, cell culture, microscopy, antigen/antibody detection, serosurveys 
* Genomic analyses: gives us an idea of drug targets, transmission, etc
* vaccine development: at least 4 different vaccines confirmed 
* Preparation of animal modeling: testing clinical manifestations etc
* Epidemiological tracking: people at risk, super spreaders, R0 value, gen time etc

#Some Insights

* It shares a crucial protein with SARS. We're targeting this for drugs. Existing compounds are already being tested in China for treatment

* Use of masks alone is insufficient to prevent infection. It can worsen problems if people believe all you need is a mask. More hygiene measures are needed: wash hands, sneeze/coughing into a disposable tissue, maintain distance of >1 m: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-health-care-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak

* Incubation period for the first 425 patients was 5.2 days. R0 differs by study. If R0 > 1, the epidemic will increase. We aim to reduce this number to < 1. **R0 = 2.2** so on average, each patient will infect 2.2 other people. Other factors play into this, like immunity

* Of the first 425 patients: 240 (56%) were male. **No** cases for children under age 15. **84** cases for ages 15-44. **179** cases between ages 45-64. **162** cases for age 65 and over. Incubation period for the first 425 patients was 5.2 days. Nearly **half** of cases occurred people over age 60. It's possible that children *are* infected but show milder symptoms. In the coming weeks, once developed, a seroprevalence study (where we test your blood serum) will give us a much better idea.

* What we're monitoring is whether exportation of cases in other countries can sustain transmission. This is crucial leading up to a pandemic. Circulation within the community is bad news. It's why surveillance, isolation, and why close contacts are being monitored.

* China does deserve some credit. If you compare the timeline with the SARS outbreak, we are doing **way** better (availability of data, transparency, measures of control, research). China hid reports of SARS and took 4 months to report to the WHO. It took **5 months to even identify** it was a coronavirus and sequence the genome. We had a genome to analyze in lab within 11 days of their announcement to WHO. I remember laying in bed and jumping up when I was notified that the complete genome was available, pretty excited

* I also want to stress that it is quite easy to sit behind a screen and throw blame around. Granted there are certain contributing factors leading to this outbreak but in my opinion, there is a time to address those. At the moment, there needs to be a focus on containment and research. If you're outside of China and worried about it, consider how it would feel to be **in** China. There are good people doing good work

The question that remains now is *what are we going to do about it?*

The consensus among [scientists](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economists](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) on [carbon pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price)^§ to mitigate climate change is similar to [the consensus among climatologists](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) that human activity is responsible for global warming. Putting the price [upstream](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658) where the fossil fuels enter the market makes it simple, easily enforceable, and bureaucratically lean. Returning the revenue as an equitable dividend [offsets any regressive effects of the tax](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9152.pdf) (in fact, [~60% of the public would receive more in dividend than they paid in tax](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648#s7)) and allows for a higher carbon price (which [is what matters for climate mitigation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S201000781840002X)) because [the public isn't willing to pay anywhere near what's needed otherwise](http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/Is-the-Public-Willing-to-Pay-to-Help-Fix-Climate-Change-.aspx). Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own. And [**a carbon tax accelerates the adoption of every other solution**](https://www.drawdown.org/frequently-asked-questions).

[Conservative estimates](http://rdcu.be/cLYO) are that failing to mitigate climate change will cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years, [starting about now](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In contrast, carbon taxes may actually *boost* GDP, if the revenue is [returned as an equitable dividend to households](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy) (the [poor tend to spend money when they've got it](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC.pdf), which [boosts economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)) not to mention [create jobs](https://econ.ucalgary.ca/manageprofile/sites/econ.ucalgary.ca.manageprofile/files/unitis/publications/1-7729354/Yamazaki_CarbonTax_JEEM_2017.pdf) and [save lives](https://globalchange.mit.edu/news-media/jp-news-outreach/shift-renewable-electricity-win-win-statewide-level).

In poor countries, [taxing carbon is progressive even *before* considering smart revenue uses](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf), because only the ""rich"" can afford fossil fuels](s) in the first place. We [won’t wean ourselves off fossil fuels without a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224), the [longer we wait to take action the more expensive it will be](http://rdcu.be/cZjG). Each year we delay costs [~$900 billion](https://cla.umn.edu/heller-hurwicz/news-events/news/policy-brief-calibrating-price-climate-risk).

Contrary to [popular belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples) the main barrier isn't lack of public support.

§ The IPCC (AR5, WGIII) [Summary for Policymakers](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) states with ""high confidence"" that tax-based policies are effective at decoupling GHG emissions from GDP (see p. 28). [Ch. 15](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf) has a more complete discussion. The U.S. [National Academy of Sciences, one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world, has also called for a carbon tax](https://www.nap.edu/download/21712). According to [IMF research](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/how-much-does-world-subsidize-oil-coal-and-gas/589000/), most of the $5.2 trillion in subsidies for fossil fuels come from not taxing carbon as we should.

I’ll lead with I’m an American so I get that this doesn’t effect me at all, I just don’t see many pro-gun folks giving any logical arguments. 

First of all. Automatic weapons are already illegal. The type of gun where you squeeze and hold the trigger and bullets continue to come out. Those are illegal. 

Semi-automatic means 1 squeeze = 1 bullet. “Assault rifle” in these instances purely refers to the cosmetic look of the gun. Technically a real assault rifle is a gun that can switch between automatic or semi automatic fire, or fire in bursts. No legal civilian rifles can do this anyways, so assault rifles as they pertain to civilians is a misnomer anyways. 

If you take a Browning BAR Mark II and an AR-15. A BAR looks like your typical hunting rifle. An AR-15 is more of what the military would use. **IN TERMS OF LEGAL USE BY CIVILIANS** they are functionally **identical**. One squeeze, one bullet, magazine fed, pistol style grip. They are literally functionally identical. But they do not really look the same. 

The argument that the pro-gun community is making is that a banning assault rifles is banning a gun for the look, not the function. It’s more about a blue ribbon for “we banned assault rifles, hooray” than about banning what they see as a problem. 

I understand this won’t get a lot of love on Reddit, I’m not after the internet points. I just hope that people can at least understand the logic of the pro-gun crowd even if they personally disagree on the fundamental issue of gun ownership.

Individual Russian athletes untainted by the scandal will still be able to compete in competitions independently under a neutral flag.**

> **WADA's executive committee took the decision after concluding Moscow had tampered with laboratory data. The agency found Russia planted fake evidence and deleted files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats. Russia has 21 days to appeal the decision through the Court of Arbitration for Sport.**

> Sky's sports correspondent Martha Kelner has said the country is expected to appeal. She continued: ""(WADA's) decision in many ways is not a surprise because it comes after the recommendation of WADA's compliance review committee. It all relates to this doping scandal which has engulfed international sport for the last few years.”

> ""Russia, at the height of that systematic doping programme, were hoodwinking the world. We heard how they passed dirty urine samples through the wall of a toilet at the Sochi Olympics in 2014 and switched them with clean samples. That was how cynical this doping programme was.""

[More from BBC:](https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/50710598)

> **Wada's executive committee made the unanimous decision in a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland. Wada president Sir Craig Reedie said the decision showed its ""determination to act resolutely in the face of the Russian doping crisis"". He added: ""For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport. The blatant breach by the Russian authorities of Rusada's reinstatement conditions demanded a robust response. That is exactly what has been delivered. Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial.""**

> **But Wada vice-president Linda Helleland said the ban was ""not enough"". ""I wanted sanctions that can not be watered down,"" she said. ""We owe it to the clean athletes to implement the sanctions as strongly as possible.""**

> **It comes after Russia's Anti Doping Agency (Rusada) was declared non-compliant for manipulating laboratory data handed over to investigators in January 2019. It had to hand over data to Wada as a condition of [its controversial reinstatement in 2018](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/45565273) after a three-year suspension for its vast state-sponsored doping scandal.**

> A total of 168 Russian athletes competed under a neutral flag at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang after the country was banned following the 2014 Games, which it hosted in Sochi. Russian athletes won 33 medals in Sochi, 13 of which were gold. Russia has been banned from competing as a nation in athletics since 2015.

> **Russia has been banned from competing as a nation in athletics since 2015. Despite the ban, Russia will be able to compete at Euro 2020 - in which St Petersburg will be a host city - as European football's governing body Uefa is not defined as a 'major event organisation' with regards to rulings on anti-doping breaches.**

> Rusada was initially declared [non-compliant in November 2015](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/34765444) after a Wada-commissioned report by sports lawyer Professor Richard McLaren alleged widespread corruption that amounted to state-sponsored doping in Russian track and field athletics. [A further report, published in July 2016, declared Russia operated a state-sponsored doping programme for four years across the ""vast majority"" of summer and winter Olympic sports.](https://www.bbc.com/sport/36823453)

> In 2018, Wada reinstated Rusada as compliant after the national agency agreed to release data from its Moscow laboratory from the period between January 2012 and August 2015. However, positive findings contained in a version courtesy of a whistleblower in 2017 were missing from the January 2019 data, which prompted a new inquiry.

> Wada's compliance review committee (CRC) recommended a raft of measures based ""in particular"" on a forensic review of inconsistencies found in some of that data. **As part of the ban, Russia may not host, or bid for or be granted the right to host any major events for four years, including the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games.**

Two students were ran over by public transport buses racing to pick up passengers.

Since then, high school and college students have been protesting peacefully against dangerous road conditions (No driving and traffic regulations and poor enforcement ). They took it upon themselves to manage traffic (creating emergency lanes; laning according to vehicle size) and checking licenses of every passing vehicle (including police vehicles) on major roads.

In retaliation, the Awami league government run student body (Chatro League) along with police officials have started firing guns, tear gas, stick charges, committing rape against these students. Keep in mind the victims are mostly teenagers between the ages 14-18. 

The major broadcast networks have been censoring any related news, and major news portals have also stopped reporting the events. We are currently relying on Facebook to spread images and videos of the situation.

[US military personnel who were supposed to self isolate for 14 days broke their quarantine and violated the Canadian Federal Quarantine Act](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/american-military-self-isolating-nl-1.5665789) which states that ANY out of province travelers must self isolate for 14 days.

We have not had an active case in our province in ten days, and I hope this isn't what changes that. I have nothing against Americans and I know many of you do not deserve the bad rep that individuals like these create for you -- some of you are working damn hard to protect others and yourselves, and you are acting responsibly during this quarantine. To the Americans who are doing that, I salute you, I care about you, and I am deeply worried for you considering that you have to share space with so many more of these inconsiderate people.

But my God, for those of you who think you are ""above"" quarantine laws, clean up your own backyard before you come in here trying to wreck ours. We've worked too hard collectively as a province with our health and safety measures over the past few months to have that all undone by the actions of a few inconsiderate visitors.

If you are in someone else's country while your country is currently the epicenter of a pandemic, follow the protocol and laws in place and just follow the damn quarantine rules. Don't go out to a restaurant and then proceed to go bar hopping like these guys did. I'm not willing to lose mine or anyone else's parents or grandparents for your selfish carelessness.

**Edit:** Thank you all for your immense kindness and perspectives to consider. I have gotten hundreds of messages from Americans who are frustrated, apologetic, scared and worried about their future. I've read them all. In a time you direly need unity, your government's mismanagement of this crisis has divided you, hurt you, humiliated you and taken some of your loved ones.

 But know that sometimes governments fail and when that happens, people need each other to come together. I was in Nepal when flash flooding took out streets, buildings and lives. When the government was not quick to act, the people got their hands dirty and came together to rebuild their own communities together. You have a different kind of rebuilding to do, but that heart and will is the same and it's there.

I can tell you from what I read, there are so many good among you who have plenty to offer. Please vote in November, and I genuinely hope that you get your country back. Thank you for your love and kindness. Stay healthy and safe neighbours. <3",14357,"""They are bringing crime; they are bringing drugs; they are rapists, and some; I assume are good people""...........

This passage explores exactly how the German people transitioned from frustrated citizens in 1933 to full-blown Nazis in 1945. Here's the thing: changes like that don't happen overnight, it takes quite a long time. The issue is that the change is so gradual, and each time things get 'worse' it's in small enough increments that people are not compelled to take action until it's too late. I urge people to look at the similarities between this passage and what is happening in the US right now. This isn't to say that Donald Trump is the next Hitler or anything, it's simply meant to draw attention to how far a people can slip when they let each 'small issue' go unpunished. The passage:

>""...Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don't want to act, or even talk, alone; you don't want to 'go out of your way to make trouble.' Why not?-Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty. Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, 'everyone' is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, 'It's not so bad' or 'You're seeing things' or 'You're an alarmist.'  
>  
>And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can't prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don't know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have....  
>  
>But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That's the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked-if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in '43 had come immediately after the 'German Firm' stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in '33. But of course this isn't the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.  
>  
>And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying 'Jewish swine,' collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in-your nation, your people-is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.""

Ex: if I wanted safety and I have a neighbor that speaks my language and is safe (we’ll call them Costa Rica), why do I then walk 3-4x the distance of my neighbor for help from “the richer” people. Could it be that I have different motives than just asylum?

I’ve never understood how you can decide you need safety/asylum but still bypass other closer/easier options because you want something “nicer.”

Edit: I didn’t expect this to receive so much interest. I just wanted to clarify, I have no problem with them requesting asylum here; however, I’m very confident that <100% will receive asylum in the US. For those that don’t get through, how did they decide to make such a journey with such a small chance of success, when there were other (less ideal) options close by? Were they really seeking asylum or just seizing an opportunity (which I can’t blame either). That’s what I was trying to verbalize.

My example of Costa Rica was thrown out there since 1) it’s close (I’m limited with my options obviously) and 2) it’s probably the best option. I don’t expect them to take in every single Spanish-speaking, asylum-seeker in the region. I was just going for ease and proximity.",2925,0.231,0.69,0.079,-0.8126,neg

To answer some brief questions:

Why I didn't go small claims You can see some people have tried and failed in various sellercentral forum posts. Because the seller agreement makes you go through arbitration first. I've spoken with a lawyer and they said I'd save more money walking away from it. I do from time to time email them to remind them about me getting my pay out every year, It an anniversary event on my calendar. [https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/small-claims-action/419991](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/small-claims-action/419991)

**Why did they suspend you?**   
I was technically not suspended, my account skipped that step. They CLOSED it. There's a big difference between suspension and closure. If you have a suspension you get to write seller performance and they'll tell you why you were suspended. My account was without warning CLOSED. When you get closed you don't get informed WHY you were closed. You are just told you're done we don't want you back.

It boggles my mind, I had 98% Lifetime feedback, my metrics were perfect the night before. I was doing enough volume to take random hits of feedback / AZ claims. I was one of those sellers called ""refund monkey"" I rather piss away money than to nickel and dime people out of moral high ground.

I asked them for evidence of wrong doing on my part by email they refused. I had to find a way to call them and the only way was to call the customer service line and get transferred to a department that handles seller support (they were doing away with telephone seller support at the time, I imagine its worse now). Guy on phone was telling me that I'd get my money in 90 days, don't make new account write seller performance and advise them that my account was closed in error, as he can see my metrics were good. I asked him to send me all that we spoke about he said he could not.

When your account is closed, you aren't given the opportunity to login to see any of your metrics anymore. You can't go in to remove your billing details. Its not the same as a suspension where you can still login and manage cases through their case log system.

**What the hell were you selling?**   
All private label goods, nothing that required FDA or certification, and not restricted categories, all the stuff was my own brand. I am still operating the company as a small hobby business on other sales channels (albeit I closed for lock down).

**Why don't you just buy 2K worth of stuff and claim its lost?**   
There's no victim less crime. You could be ruining it for the person that's picking and packing your order trying to put food on the table. AZ may never check the footage and just blame that person for messing up and sending you an empty box. That person will be kicked to the curb, and because AZ was the only game in town this person is now unemployed.

I can't have that on myself even if I dislike Amazon.  


**People like a happy ending give us some closure**  
I'm fine, 2K lost would be like having one of my good on account clients close down during a bad time and having unpaid bills. The only difference in this was that that Amazon accused me of wrong doing and then did not back it up with any evidence. I was lucky as I never over leveraged myself when I started that AZ account, I never bought stock on credit.

They wanted to contain this so badly, but all the steps they have taken in arresting journalists, cutting out internet, having Bollywood stars try to shift the narrative AWAY from Rihanna and Greta's tweets AND now this... it keeps backfiring!

The Indian gov is rattled hahaha

EDIT: Post got attention, so I'm going to tell you why the farmers are protesting:

Imagine if your government decided to scrap minimum wage? The corporates you work for decide how much you earn, and you can't do anything about it because of the balance of power. They are the big corporate, backed by the government, and you are just you.

That is what is happening with these farmers. The farming laws passed do not guarantee the farmers a ""Minimum Support Price (MSP)"" for their crops. These are small-time farmers, not like farmers in the west who own and farm hundreds of acres of land. The laws will be exploitative and make these farmers, a lot of whom are already in debt, even more worse off.

They have been peacefully protesting outside New Delhi since November. And in that time, they have been attacked by the Delhi Police and state-sponsored goons. They have had their water supplies cut. They have had their internet cut. And journalists who want to speak on this? They lock them up.

People like Rihanna and Greta Thunberg have put a spotlight on the issue.

Keep raising awareness, fight back against their propaganda machine, and maybe we will see change.

* Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi were two of the five hijackers of AA Flight 77, which they crashed into the Pentagon.

* Fahad al-Thumairy, ""a Saudi Islamic Affairs official and radical cleric who served as the imam of the King Fahd Mosque in Los Angeles,"" and Omar al-Bayoumi, ""a suspected Saudi government agent,"" provided assistance to Mihdhar and Hazmi when they arrived in America in January of 2000. Bayoumi specifically set them up with an apartment, lent them money, and helped set up bank accounts.

* Thumairy and Bayoumi were the subject of a 2012 FBI probe. The FBI believes they provided the aid under the direction of a ""third man."" The third man's name was revealed to the lawyers of 9/11 victims' families in a lawsuit about links between the Saudi government and the hijackers, but was never revealed publicly.

* A recently unsealed declaration in the case wasn't properly censored and revealed his last name: Jarrah. This is likely Mussaed Ahmed al-Jarrah, ""a mid-level Saudi Foreign Ministry official who was assigned to the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C., in 1999 and 2000."" Jarrah's duties ""apparently included overseeing the activities of Ministry of Islamic Affairs employees at Saudi-funded mosques and Islamic centers within the United States.""

* Former embassy employees believed that Jarrah reported to Prince Bandar bin Sultan al-Saud, a grandson of King Abdulaziz ibn Saud and US ambassador from 1998 to 2005. Jarrah's current whereabouts are unconfirmed, but he is believed to be residing in Saudi Arabia.

* The declaration was by Jill Sanborn, assistant director of the FBI's counterterrorism division.

While the protesters who are majority Punjabi Sikhs protest in New Delhi, they have set up communal kitchens, which have been feeding the surrounding slums children for the last 23 days, set up temporary schools for the impoverished children, and have donated blood, food, and clothing to all.

This protest is getting no attention because Ambani, who owns something around 5 billion dollars worth of Facebook stock has been lobbying social media groups to censor Sikhs, and have flooded #Sikh with pornographic images.

Overshoot day pertains to absolutely nothing... but global emission rates. There is only so much emissions humanity can spew into the air that the earth can naturally offset.

Canada should be rightfully pissed. And no, I don't think WW3's going to happen. This is going to be a giant political mess.",10888,"Posted this on a comment that is three comments deep, so reposting on the main thread.  
I was an AEGIS radar/missile tech for 21 years. Here is my take right after the incident happened.  
  
I am wagering an educated guess here that the technical difficulties on the plane were transponder related. If the defense missile systems the Iranian use were set up with auto interrogation, which is a fairly common thing, and the plane had issues with their transponder, which also happens then it is possible that the defense system cued the commercial flight as hostile or suspect and either launched a missile at the plane (not sure of Irans capabilities and limitations with their missile systems in regards to auto-fire) or an inexperienced operator with weapon release authority pressed a button to shoot a missile at what his system was telling him was a bad guy. 

Missile systems have a series of electronic breaks (think buttons that open and close relays allowing the missile firing voltage to reach the igintor) and mechanical breaks (think keys that have to be inserted and turned to the live/fire position). As the threat level increases the operators automate more of the process by closing these breaks. This makes for a faster response time to any threat the system identifies. 

So was it possible that an Iranian missile system was set with the minimum number of breaks/automated in a way a missile could have been inadvertently fired? I would say absolutely this is plausible given the attack a few hours prior with an expectation of an American response.

Edit: changed IFF to transponder. I had originally put this in terms of IFF because that is the system my equipment used to make the interrogations and we called it getting the IFF mode 3, for 21 years so the terminology was stuck in my brain. I have clarified this in many responses but thought I should edit it here to clear up any confusion.",9315,0.0,0.763,0.237,0.4767,pos

1 - yes, it’s only in public buildings. You can still buy them in shops

2 - no they’re not terrible. The way that my institution has done it (and has done for years) is to have free sanitary vending machines with branded products in them- the same as you might buy in a shop. They come in little boxes of two medium pads or tampons.

3 - it’s not nearly as big a change as you think. Universities and schools have been doing this for years. No one here is even really talking about it because it’s obvious

4. Yes it is amazing when you panic because you’ve forgotten to bring a tampon to the library only to remember they’ve got your back

They really don’t have to make the free tampons terrible because??? They’re tampons??? No one’s eating them??? Everyone still buys their own if they can afford because they have a preferred fit / don’t want to take too many from the public machine. The only people who’d stockpile for later are people who can’t afford to buy them and need  it most.

5 years ago there was a tv show called The Newsroom. It was mostly a serious tv show with some comedic tones about the world of media. There is a [famous 5 minutes clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc1vrO6iL0U) about climate collapse. 

#Global Warming - intro:

The below is based on this collection of [sources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13hjFQnyRHfQiSZ2fHD4jjvudaPOR99WwZHwdImylD_4/edit) and the doc [here]( https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1162767410862202880.html)

[According to a 2018 report]( https://www.climatecentral.org/gallery/graphics/the-globe-is-already-above-1c) the have the current global temperature is above 1C the pre-industrial mean. What will happen with every 0.5? [The climate action tracker shows we will reach a 3.5C with the current policies by 2050]( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ECL96ggWkAA-5Z6.jpg).

*1.5C* - This used to be the point at which scientists thought we were OK. In 2018 the IPCC wanted to stop global warming at this temperature predicting we will hit it with a 10% chance by 2023. At this temperature, heatwaves across the globe will happen every single year, and these 'new' heatwaves will be as hot as the Sahara Desert. There will be massive crop destruction, 70% of coral in the ocean will be bleached, and drought will affect 360M people. [source]( https://i.imgur.com/BO0dlLh.png ). *Guess what* [according to the month-old IPCC 2019 report we are almost at 1.5C already]( https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2019/08/SPM1-approval-FINAL.pdf). The number of loss events (Tsunamis, storms, flood, wildfire) between 1980-2015 has [QUADRUPLED]( https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/22.jpg).

Historically, every climate [summit]( https://i.imgur.com/23GA1Pm.jpg) missed their target of limiting GHG emissions by a lot.  [Another angle]( https://i.imgur.com/cMpuRwJ.png). Since the adoption of the Paris climate accord at the end of 2015, 33 global banks have provided [$1.9 trillion to fossil fuel companies](https://www.ran.org/press-releases/bankingonclimatechange_2019/). The amount of financing has risen in each of the past two years. 

Where is this shift to cleaner sources of energy? In the last 12 years the share of carbon-free electricity has barely budged[Our pathetically slow shift to clean energy, in five charts](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614917/our-pathetically-slow-shift-to-clean-energy-in-five-charts/)

## Biomass and 6th extinction

Earth appears to be undergoing a process of ""biological annihilation.""Humanity Has Killed 83% of All Wild Mammals and Half of All Plants, Of all the birds left in the world, 70% are poultry chickens and other farmed birds[Source](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/humans-destroyed-83-of-wildlife-report/). A 2017 study looked at animal populations across the planet by examining 27,600 vertebrate species — about half of the overall total that we know exist. They found that more than 30% of them are in decline. Some species are facing total collapse, while local populations of others are going extinct in specific areas. Moreover humans wiped out 60% of animal populations since 1970 [Source]( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/30/humanity-wiped-out-animals-since-1970-major-report-finds)

Insects are dying off at record rates. Roughly 40% of the world's insect species are in decline, according to one study. Insects aren't the only creatures taking a hit. In the past 50 years, more than 500 amphibian species have declined worldwide — and 90 have gone extinct — due to a deadly fungal disease that corrodes frog flesh. [Source](https://www.businessinsider.com/signs-of-6th-mass-extinction-2019-3?IR=T)

And Plants are going extinct up to 350 times faster than the [historical norm]( https://qz.com/africa/1694276/plants-are-going-extinct-350-times-faster-than-normal/)

On the other hand, [Look at the explosion](https://i.imgur.com/dXdidBf.jpg) of domesticated animals between 1950 and 2000. Cattle is one of the causes of  global warming. Ie. The Amazon is being cut down not for lumber but to make room for cattle [Source]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6DFvW2c4rk) Our hope in her is all the Beyondmeat, Impossible burger which are not using animal protein and are way better for the environment.

Re: fishes. There are entire “dark fleets” that turn off their transponders, allowing them to hide illicit activity such as [illegal fishing](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/illegal-fishing-global-fishing-watch). With one in five fish now caught illegally, and with 93 per cent of commercial stocks now fully- or over-exploited, the drive to end overfishing was never been more needed. Or The Gulf of Alaska is to close for the first time ever, No more cod, Salmon all but gone, [Millions of small sea birds died since 2015](https://www.thebigwobble.org/2019/12/fish-all-gone-gulf-of-alaska-fishery-to.html). Europe is in the same “boat” [Report about overshing in the Baltic sea 2019](https://neweconomics.org/2018/11/landing-the-blame-baltic-2019) and the Mediterranean is the world most overfished sea [Source](https://eu.oceana.org/en/press-center/press-releases/un-alert-mediterranean-worlds-most-overfished-sea). The overfishing is one of the reasons of a possible conflict in the South China sea. [The Fishing wars](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/16/asia-is-trawling-for-a-deadly-fishing-war/). 

And have you heard about bottom-trawling? A quarter of the world’s seafood caught in the ocean is collected through this method. New analysis, which brings together the contributions of 57 scientists across 22 countries, suggests that 14 per cent of the seafloor, shallower than 1,000m, is [trawled](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/university-of-washington-bottom-trawling-seafloor-report-ecosystems-a8574381.html)
 
[The bleaching of the Barrier reefs](https://youtu.be/Rmkyj9qghGY) or the [“dead zones”](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/news/could-dark-carbon-be-concealing-the-true-scale-of-ocean-dead-zones) are also caused by Global warming.‘Dead zones’ within the world’s oceans – where there is almost no oxygen to sustain life – could be expanding far quicker than currently thought, a new study suggests. The regions are created when large amounts of organic material produced by algae sinks towards the seafloor, using up the oxygen present in the deep water.

## Population

[The steep curve of population]( https://i.imgur.com/5fEjb2t.png). If our numbers grow by 228,000 on an average day, then in one week, we will have added about 1,589,000 extra persons to world population. And five days after that we will add another million and then another and another, and we are on track to continue this way repeatedly into the foreseeable future. Never before in human history have we asked our governments, infrastructure, social institutions, earth's environment, and the social fabric of our civilizations to respond to and accommodate such mammoth increase numbers in such compressed [periods of time.]( https://www.populationinstitute.org/programs/gpso/gpso/). To prepare for it Humanity must produce more food in the next four decades than we have in the last 8,000 [years]( https://richardvanhooijdonk.com/blog/en/humanity-must-produce-more-food-in-the-next-four-decades-than-we-have-in-the-last-8000-years-the-dutch-may-have-the-solutions/) But we are wasting so much food and losing so much water in irrigation that taking all this into account Society will collapse by 2040 due to catastrophic food shortages. The results show that based on plausible climate trends, and a total failure to change course, the global food supply system would face catastrophic losses, and an unprecedented epidemic of food riots.

""Lifttoff. From the edge of a tropical rainforest to the edge of time itself, James Webb begins a voyage back to the birth of the universe.""",11920,Please just let it unfold correctly,10765,"Astronomer here!  What an amazing Christmas present for anyone who loves space!!!

I took the liberty of writing a few notes down, because while I know some of you know every nuance of [James Webb Space Telescope \(JWST\)](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/), many more people have the same general questions.  So, with that…

**What is JWST and how does it compare to Hubble?**  JWST is the long-awaited successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, which launched in the early 1990s and revolutionized astronomy in a Nobel-prizewinning way.  However, we have many new frontiers in astronomy Hubble is not able to probe, from finding the first stars to details about exoplanets, and JWST is poised to do that!  First of all, [it is just plain bigger](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13521)- the mirror size is what is key in astronomy, and Hubble’s is 8 feet across (2.4m), but JWST’s is ~21 feet (6.5m) across!  In terms of sheer bulk, Hubble is about the size of a bus, but JWST is the size of a tennis court (due to a giant sun shield)- this truly is the next generation's telescope!

Second, the *light itself* JWST will see is literally different than Hubble.  Hubble is basically set up to see the light our eyes does, but JWST is going to see only the orange/red light your eyes see, and the infrared light *beyond* red that you don't see.  Why?  Because the further you peer into space, the more ""[redshifted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift)"" the light becomes, aka what is normal light to us emitted billions of years ago now appears in infrared.  So, if you want to look to the furthest reaches of the universe, that's where you've gotta look.

Finally, JWST is *not* orbiting Earth like Hubble, but instead will be outside Earth's orbit beyond the distance to the moon from us, at a special point called [L2](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/754/what-is-a-lagrange-point/).  This was chosen because there are several advantages to it- the infrared instruments on JWST need to be kept *very* cold, beyond levels what even the environment around Earth can get to.  As an added side bonus to astronomers, JWST is not limited to observing only ~half its time like Hubble is (due to being in the sun half the time in its orbit), and thanks to having a sun shield we almost get 24 hours a day to observe!  There are definite disadvantages though- JWST is currently only built to last ~10 years because it's limited by the amount of fuel on it (Hubble, OTOH, has stayed in orbit thanks to multiple missions by astronauts from the space shuttle days to fix/upgrade it).  The good news is being able to upgrade JWST in ~10 years when needed (most likely via robotics) was listed by various NASA admins as a top priority... so let's keep clamoring they follow through on supporting their investment!

**What new science can we expect?** NASA (and the ESA and Canada, also big partners in JWST costs) don't just spend billions of dollars on a next generation space telescope without damn good plans on why it's needed, and in fact for JWST there are key science goals outlined already.  They are:

- To study light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang

- To study the formation and evolution of said galaxies

- To understand the formation of stars and planetary systems

- To study planetary systems and the origins of life.

Those are all revolutionary goals in themselves, but that said, it's important to note that whenever you get an instrument like this that's just leagues ahead of anything there's been before, you *will* make new discoveries no one expected because the universe is just so amazing beyond our wildest imaginations (it happens every time, and is one of the most incredible things about astronomy IMO).  For one example, do you know why it was called the Hubble Space Telescope?  Because it was built to measure the [Hubble constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law), which drives the expansion of the universe.  But incidentally along the way Hubble was used to discover [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy), the [Hubble Deep Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Deep_Field), and just revolutionize astronomy in many ways, all while creating beautiful images for all the world for free.  There's so much to uncover, and we don't even know it all yet!

To give you an idea, those key science goals were outlined many years ago by astronomers, and the research group I'm in got JWST time... to follow up on a [neutron star merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star_merger) if one meets our specific criteria in the first year of science operations. (I'm not in charge of this data myself, but you can *bet* I'll be looking over the shoulder of my colleague as it comes in!) Seeing as we have only ever literally seen *one* of these mergers in actual detail before (with LIGO/Hubble- JWST can detect them to much greater distances), I *know* those results will be incredible!

**Enough talk- when are we getting the first pictures?!**  Probably about six months, I'm sorry to say, because a *ton* of work still has to happen.  First the telescope has to travel to the L2 point and unfurl into its giant size from its rocket casing size, which is going to take several weeks and is rather anxiety-inducing to discuss in detail on my Christmas holiday, so let's not.  This is going to take about a month.  Then you need to do things like align the mirror properly ([its famous 18 segments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/ogabbj/i_cross_stitched_a_tribute_to_the_james_webb/) gotta be perfectly fit together, and it's a *super* slow process) and then you have to make sure the instruments actually focus- another 4 months.  Finally, there are a small number of ""easy science"" commissioning targets to put the instruments through their paces, and those are going to give you the first images.  I promise, they'll be front page on every geek and non-geek news outlet on Earth when they're out, so you won't miss it.  They will be better than Hubble's, no doubt, and converted on the computer to take into account the infrared light over optical (sorry to report if you hadn't heard before, but all pretty Hubble images were heavily post-processed too).

And then, the real fun begins- Cycle 1!  Last year JWST had its first open call for science proposals, where literally anyone on Earth can propose a project for JWST to do- you just need to make a good enough case to convince a panel of astronomers that you deserve that precious telescope time.  Those projects are already approved, and you can read all about them [here](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-programs/cycle-1-go)!  I'm incredibly excited to see how this first science cycle goes, both in my group's research but also to see what my talented colleagues who got time will do with it!

This has gone on long enough, but to wrap up... it's very surreal for me to see JWST launch (I wasn't expecting how nervous I got even compared to other launches).  I became interested in astronomy at age 13, circa 2000, so it's no joke to say over half my life has been waiting for JWST to launch (why it's taken so long is subject to another post sometime).  It's such a personal and professional milestone for me to see it happen!  And for all the 13 year olds out there getting interested in astronomy now thanks to JWST (and older)- wow, do we have a lot of exciting discoveries in store in the coming years! And maybe someday you'll get time of your own on JWST- as I said, anyone on Earth can potentially do it if you study hard enough!

**TL;DR** Today is historic because JWST is going to revolutionize astronomy, no hype in saying that, but it's gonna be a little while until the first pictures come through yet",6809,0.0,0.561,0.439,0.5719,pos

> A prison strike has begun to take hold in custodial institutions across North America, with reports of sporadic protest action from California and Washington state to the eastern seaboard as far south as Florida and up to Nova Scotia in Canada.

> The 19-day strike is the first such nationwide action in the US in two years and was triggered by April&#039;s rioting in Lee correctional institution in South Carolina in which seven inmates were killed.

> Among the main tactics that are being deployed in the strike are a refusal to work, a boycott of purchases at prison commissaries, sit-ins and hunger strikes.

**General Staff of** **Iran's Armed Forces:** has issued a statement saying that the Ukranian plane was ""unintentionally"" hit by a military site & based on ""human error"". The statement has offered ""apology"" to the families of victims & foreign nationals.

Further more; While the plane was turning around, it went toward a sensitive military center of IRGC and it was at an altitude & in the shape of a hostile aircraft, in which the aircraft was inadvertently hit based on human error.

Iran's Armed Forces says ""human error"" happened while the sensitivity in Iranian air defense system had increased due to the threats of US president & officials & increased number of American aircraft around the country & receiving some reports on targets approaching strategic centers .Several targets were observed in some \[Iranian\] radars, which incited further sensitivity at the Air Defense units.

Fundamental reforms in the operational processes at the Armed Forces"" will take place to ""make it impossible to repeat such errors"", saying the people who made the error will be introduced to Judicial Organization of Armed Forces to be dealt with legally.

**The Turning Plane Claim (Correction):**  Under such sensitive and critical circumstances, the Ukrainian airline’s Flight PS752 took off from Imam Khomeini Airport, and when turning around (No explanation given as to **WHY** or **IF** the plane was turning around), it approached a sensitive military site of the IRGC, taking the shape and altitude of a hostile target. In such conditions, due to human error and in an unintentional move, the airplane was hit \[by the Air Defence\], which caused the martyrdom of a number of our compatriots and the deaths of several foreign nationals.

The relevant authorities at the IRGC were also instructed to appear on state TV and give detailed explanation of the incident as soon as possible.

What it can do, however, is authorize the secretariat of the UN to commence a public investigation into particular situations. It is also a useful tool for outlining international consensus on issues of human rights. Unlike what most people think, the UNHRC does *not* legally outline human rights. That is the purpose of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (it is also *not* the purpose of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, that is a non-binding policy document). The UNHRC has 47 members.

Terms on the UNHRC are three years but may be non-consecutively renewed. Its oversight big six body is interestingly the UN General Assembly and not ECOSOC (which was its predecessor's oversight committee). In this case, Russia has been removed from the UNHRC through a two-thirds majority vote at the UNGA which is a mechanism inherent to the UNHRC. 

What does this mean practically? Well generally it means that Russia can no longer participate at the council, meaning it can no longer speak (subject to being granted permission to do so as an observer) it can no longer vote, and it can no longer provide draft resolutions. Though it can run for re-election. In honesty, this is more of a politically symbolic gesture than anything, and this is coming from someone who strongly supports the power of diplomatic and international legal action. That said, it certainly doesn't mean its useless nor does it mean it isn't significant. It sets precedent for states that if they want to be on the HRC, they cannot use the body to peddle falsehoods or propaganda and remain a member to it and again, has removed a legitimate media outlet from Russia's repertoire. In fact to my knowledge, this is the ~~first~~ second (I forgot about Libya in 2011, thank you for the correction) ever time that a party has been forcibly removed from the UNHRC.

>Things become tense when Bregman tells Carlson that Fox News has tended to ignore tax because “what the Murdochs want you to do is scapegoat immigrants instead of talking about tax avoidance”.

>**Bregman then accuses Carlson of being bought by the Murdoch family and the Cato Institute, a rightwing thinktank of which Carlson was a fellow until 2015. Bregman says Tucker took the “dirty money” of the institute, which is funded in large part by the Koch brothers and opposes higher taxes.**

>**He says Carlson is “a millionaire funded by billionaires” and “not part of the solution” but “part of the problem, actually”.**

>Bregman finishes by acknowledging that the interview probably wouldn’t be aired, but saying that he “went to Davos to speak truth to power and I’m doing exactly the same right now”.

>**Carlson, near-speechless for much of the interview, replies by saying: “Why don’t you go fuck yourself, you tiny brain. You’re a moron. I tried to give you a hearing but you were too fucking annoying.”**

For those that may not know Dutch historian Rutger Bregman studies poverty and global inequality. He was invited 
as a guest speaker to the world’s most prominent gathering of wealthy people - the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Bregman's speech became a viral hit as he criticized the ultrarich for avoiding taxes.^[[2]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/31/an-angry-historian-ripped-ultra-rich-over-tax-avoidance-davos-then-one-was-given-mic/?utm_term=.23f9715841cc)

> Putin is particularly angry about a recent European parliament resolution that said the Soviet Union bore responsibility for starting the second world war, alongside Nazi Germany.

> Over his two decades in charge of Russia, Putin has turned victory in the second world war, still referred to there as the Great Patriotic War, into the foundation stone of his rule, calling on all Russians to be proud of the immense Soviet sacrifice in the war and railing at western nations who downplay the Soviet war effort.

Edit : the air is poisonous, people are asked to stay home and close windows and wash themselves if they were outside. Problem is most of the windows in building are destroyed.
You need to know that the port is located at the exact opposit of the airport, which is around 15min drive. And the airport got damaged. So everything in between got hit in some way

Latest update : 7km diameter of direct damage. Buildings windows in that zone shattered in an instant. Hospitals full and no electricity, doctors are doing operations in the streets, people are fighting for survival. Port completely destroyed. FYI, lebanon does alot of import, specially now with economy crisis and medical shortage. We were expecting food and medical supplies by port this week. That won't be happening 

Latest update : firemen still working but almost there. Hospitals full but manageable. Ambulances everywhere, the city sounds crying.. Tomorrow we will realise how much we lost and really see what happened
Number of death and injuries aren't officially done, they say 63 deaths and more than 3000 injured 

Latest update : hello again everyone, it's morning over here, everyone is still in disbelief.. Half of the city is devastated, you can find impacts in every street.. News wise, fire is still being put out, as a small one erupted this morning at the explosion site, but mostly managed. Hospitals are full but able to take care of new people. Ambulances and red cross non stop everywhere, they'll start looking in building, they expect people stuck under ruble and more injured people to come up during the day. Death count is at 83 and rising, red cross expects over 100 and injuries are more than 4000.
I updated the links for donations, for now people are sharing those two most as they don't trust other NGO.. You'll find them at the bottom of this comment

Thank you everyone for you comments and support! It's wonderful to see strangers being kind and generous. Gives hope in this crazy world and that's what makes us special! 

Much love from Lebanon and if you want help you can donate at the Lebanese Red Cross app. They have their own app but you'll need to create an account or here :

Furthermore, unlike the recent motions in the United Kingdom, Canada and United States, this effort does not make the significant step of declaring such activities as genocide.

The adopted motion was as follows:

> ""That this House is gravely concerned about the severe human rights abuses taking place against Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and that it call on the Government to work with the United Nations, international partners, and to work with all relevant instruments of international law to bring these abuses to an end.""

Proposed by the libertarian Act Party, [the motion was originally much stronger in its language, and did in fact include the genocide terminology](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/125028833/labour-waters-down-acts-xinjiang-genocide-parliamentary-motion), however this was reportedly removed in order to secure the support of the Labour Party.

This is not the first statement made by New Zealand on the Uyghur crisis. Earlier this year the Government issued a [joint statement alongside Australia](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/joint-statement-human-rights-abuses-xinjiang), and NZ has previously both [welcomed sanctions imposed upon China by the United States and European Union](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2021/03/new-zealand-australia-welcome-sanctions-over-china-s-alleged-uighur-atrocities.html), signed [a letter to the United Nations Human Rights Council](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/stern-words-as-new-zealand-joins-rebuke-of-china-over-uighurs-muslims/DUR3FRL6DZUW2IKOCTFXNU6KAI/) expressing concern, and has also issued a range of statements on other issues related to China (such as the Hong Kong Security Law) both individually, alongside Australia, and with other international partners.

Given New Zealand is [(currently) unable to impose sanctions on any country without a UN mandate](https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/peace-rights-and-security/un-sanctions/) this is a major step, that will perhaps spark further action in the future.

It doesn't look their test group included people who had other conditions.",5179,"Alright, so as a physician who regularly reads research articles, I hate seeing misleading headlines. I actually read through this research paper and here are some of the big issues I have with it that make these claims not nearly as promising as they seem.

1) All samples from positive covid patients were taken from patients who had symptoms and all negative samples taken from patients who had no symptoms. So the dogs may not be detecting presence of covid, but instead presence of symptoms.

2) All positive covid samples were taken from hospitalized patients and all negative samples from non-hospitalized patients, so the dogs may not be detecting covid, but whether it came from a hospitalized patient or nonhospitalized patient.

3) Negative samples were all nasopharyngeal swabs, but some of the positive samples were taken from tracheobronchial secretions (from intubated patients, far deeper in the airways than a normal swab and absolutely not something you would perform on a non-criticially ill patient). It's possible the dogs aren't detecting the presence of covid, but the presence of tracheobronchial secretions. You might quote the article when it says, ""There was no notable difference in detection ability between saliva and tracheal secretion."" But it doesn't give us the raw numbers to decide if there's a stasticially significant difference or not, this is a conclusion the authors give without providing the data to support it.

4) The covid positive samples were inactivated with beta propiolactone (BPL) (to protect the dogs from getting sick). We are told that ""dogs were provided both negative control samples with and without previous BPL treatment"" but we have no idea how this was included in the study. How many negative samples had BPL? Were they presented with the same negative sample that didn't have BPL? Were they presented at the same time in one of the seven sniffing holes? How many of each sample were there? Does this mean there were additional options for the dog to select from regarding the same negative sample? All things that would bias this study quite a bit and we aren't told the numbers methods on any of it. Since ALL the positive samples had BPL and only SOME of the negative samples did, then perhaps the dogs aren't detecting the presence of covid, but the presence of BPL.

5) The inactivation process for positive samples with bpl (to keep the dogs safe) involve a number of procedures that the negative samples do not undergo. Rather than detecting the presence of covid, perhaps the dogs are detecting the presence of samples kept at 4C (in positive samples) vs the negative samples that were not, or perhaps they are detecting the sodium bicarbonate added to the positive samples that were not added to the negative samples. Perhaps the dogs are detecting the positive samples for having then been heated to 37C when the negative samples were not.

6) THE CRUX OF THE STUDY relies on whether a dog determines whether a particular samples is positive or negative. The paper describes quite well how the dogs were trained, but is shockingly unclear as to how it determines whether a sample is positive or not during the actual randomized control trial.  Is it only positive if it correctly goes to a positive sniffing hole on the first attempt? Is it positive if it spends the most time at the positive sniffing hole? Is it positive if it eventually ends up and settles on a positive sniffing hole? How many positive and negatives are presented at a time? (This is mentioned for training, but not for the trial itself.) Are there trials when no positive sample is presented, or multiple positive samples? These questions are absolutely crucial in determining whether the study design itself is flawed and biased.

7) The sample size is not nearly as large as it appears. While the number of samples prepared was 10,388 ""sample presentations"", samples from only 7 infected patients and 7 noninfected patients were used! Samples from the same patients were reused multiple times for all of these sample presentations. It is quite likely that some other confounding variable with a particular patient or patients is what the dogs are detecting, rather than the presence of covid, since only samples from 7 patients were used in each arm.

8) The paper reports on negative predictive value and positive predictive value, which are both inherently a measure of the prevalence of disease in a population. In a study like this where the percentage of positive and negative samples presented to the dogs don't reflect the percentage of positive cases in real life, these metrics are meaningless. The only reason to report them here would be if the authors aren't sure what these metrics actually are, or if they're intentionally trying to be misleading.

9) The headline (a news headline, I understand) mentions 94% ""accuracy"" which is not a meaningful metric is research like this. I can make a machine that detects whether each individual entering an airport is a terrorist or not with 99% accuracy for example. It would simply say that no one is a terrorist every single time. Since more than 99% of people aren't terrorists, it would be accurate more than 99% of the time. More meaningful metrics are sensitivity and specificity.

For what it's worth, if I was on the peer review committee for this journal I would reject this paper outright.",3539,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,neu

> Mr Trump is quoted countering: “No, all of us have to be together. Germany has to do something.

There is no benefit for him in this behavior because it doesn’t help his base or his donors, so he must owe Putin big time for something else.  He’s been funded by Russian money since 1984: 


Trump was over a billion in debt and the Russians bailed him out.

► Trump was first compromised by the Russians in the 80s. In 1984, the Russian Mafia began to use Trump real estate to launder money. In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as laundering money for the Russian mob through Trump's real estate, but evolved into something far bigger.

► In 1984, David Bogatin — a convicted Russian mobster and close ally of Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss — met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob. (NY Times, Apr 30, 1992)

► Felix Sater is a Russian-born former mobster, and former managing director of NY real estate conglomerate Bayrock Group LLC located on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. He is a convict who became a govt cooperator for the FBI and other agencies. He grew up with Michael Cohen--Trump's former ""fixer"" attorney. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his in-laws and his brother's in-laws. Felix Sater's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years.

► Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through Bayrock (mentioned above). Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan-born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman who had pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia. Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.

► In July 2008, the height of the housing bust, Trump sold a mansion in Palm Beach for $95 million to Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian oligarch. Trump had purchased it four years earlier for $41.35 million. The sale price was nearly $54 million more than Trump had paid for the property. Again, this was the height of the recession when all other property had plummeted in value.

► Semion Mogilevich was the brains behind the Russian Mafia. Mogilevich operatives have been using Trump real estate for decades to launder money. That means Russian Mafia operatives have been part of his fortune for years. Many of them owned condos in Trump Towers and other properties. They were running operations out of Trump's crown jewel.

► From Craig Unger's AMA: ""Early on, a source told me that all this was tied to Semion Mogilevich, the powerful Russian mobster. I had never even heard of him, but I immediately went to a database that listed the owners of all properties in NY state and looked up all the Trump properties. Every time I found a Russian sounding name, I would Google, and add Mogilevich. When you do investigative reporting, you anticipate drilling a number of dry holes, but almost everyone I googled turned out to be a Russian mobster. Again and again. If you know New York you don't expect Trump Tower to be a high crime neighborhood, but there were far too many Russian mobsters in Trump properties for it to be a coincidence.""

►  So many Russians bought Trump apartments at his developments in Florida that the area became known as Little Moscow. The developers of two of his hotels were Russians with significant links to the Russian mob. The late leader of that mob in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, was living at Trump Tower

► According to a Bloomberg investigation (3/16/2017) into Trump World Tower,  “a third of units sold on floors 76 through 83 by 2004 involved people or limited liability companies connected to Russia and neighboring states.”

► In 2013, Federal agents busted an “ultraexclusive, high-stakes, illegal poker ring” run by Russian gangsters out of Trump Tower. They operated card games, illegal gambling websites, and a global sports book and laundered more than $100 million. A condo directly below one owned by Trump reportedly served as HQ for a “sophisticated money-laundering scheme” connected to Semion Mogilevich.

► The Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. Russia is a mafia state. that is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States is deeply disturbing.

►  Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive. Now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the FBI described Kislin as having ties tot he Russian mob. Of course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.

► A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. The NRA got as much as $70M from Russia, then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee lead by McConnel got millions from Leonard Blavatnik. In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like Speaker of the House Tom Delay. Unger's book alleges that most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money.

► At the Cityscape USA’s Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, on September 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business, saying ""...And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.""

► Eric Trump told golf reporter James Dodson in 2014 that the Trump Organization was able to expand during the financial crisis because “We don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.”

► Russian oligarchs co-signed Trump’s Deutsche bank loans.

Trump now gleefully takes cues from Putin:

► At the end of 2018, Putin and his allies started making a strong push for a resolution that would justify their country’s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and reverse an 1989 vote backed by Mikhail Gorbachev that condemned it. The Putinists’ goal was to pass the resolution by Feb. There is no one on this side of the Atlantic who thinks the USSR was justified in invading Afghanistan. And out of nowhere, on January 2nd, Trump came out strongly supporting Russia's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.

► Trump went against American intelligence on North Korean missiles. He told the FBI he didn't believe their intelligence because Putin told him otherwise. ""I don't care, I believe Putin""

► Trump met in secret with Putin the G20 summit in November 2018, without note takers. 19 days later, he announced a withdrawal from Syria. As a note, Trump conducted FIVE completely private meetings and conferences with Putin, and has gone to great lengths to prevent literally anyone, even people in his administration, from learning what was discussed.

► Trump refused to enforce sanctions legally codified into law - and in some cases reversed standing sanctions on Russian companies.

► He has denounced his own intelligence agencies in a press conference with Putin on election meddling - and publicly endorsed Putin's version of events.

► Trump pulled out of the INF treaty with no explanation, which allows Putin to create long-range hypersonic missiles that threaten Europe with impunity. The US already has all the weaponry that the INF would ban the development of, so this offers us literally nothing, while allowing Russia to develop powerful new weapons to challenge our allies.

► Demanded Russia get invited back into G7

► Pushed the CIA to give American intelligence to the Kremlin.

► Withdrew from the Open Skies treaty

► Received intelligence in 2019 that Russia was paying bounties for dead American soldiers, and hasn't done anything about it by the time of this writing.

► Announced troop withdrawal from Germany (America's missile defense from Russia and forward operating base against Russian aggression)

► And of course, Trump continues to threaten to pull out of NATO, a move so catastrophically stupid, so inconceivably cosmically myopic, I truly can't express the profundity of the idiocy. Suffice to say, pulling out of NATO would be like the only guy in a prison yard with a shotgun just throwing it over the fence for absolutely no reason, suddenly giving the people with crude homemade shivs complete power.",8753,Stuff like this is why I always liked the theory that Trump’s campaign was a publicity stunt gone wrong.,3763,0.154,0.754,0.092,-0.296,neg

The full statement according to [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/18/state-dept-mh17-ukraine-russia-netherlands-malaysian-airlines/) who broke this story:

> Statement by Heather NAUERT, SPOKESPERSON

> Remembering the Shoot Down of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17

> Today marks the fourth anniversary of the downing of Malaysia Flight #17 (MH-17) over eastern Ukraine and the horrific deaths of 298 civilians.  We again offer our deepest condolences to their families.

> Four years after the downing of MH-17, the world still awaits Russia’s acknowledgement of its role.  The United States has complete confidence in the findings of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), including those announced on May 24, 2018, and in the JIT’s ongoing work.  Based on an extensive compilation of images and other evidence, the JIT provided conclusive evidence that the BUK Transporter Erector Launcher (TELAR) from which the missile that downed MH-17 was fired, came from Russia’s 53rd Anti-aircraft Missile Brigade, a unit of the Russian army.  Like a fingerprint, the combination of matching characteristics derived from the JIT’s images clearly and conclusively proves that the BUK TELAR that downed MH-17 came from the 53rd Brigade in Russia, was brought into sovereign Ukrainian territory from Russia, was fired from Russia-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine, and was then returned to Russian territory.

> It is time for Russia to cease its callous disinformation campaign and fully support the next investigative phase of the JIT and the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the downing of flight MH-17.  We will never forget the 298 innocent civilian lives tragically lost on that day, and we call for justice on their behalf.",9395,"I mean, if Trump doesn't condemn Putin for poisoning people on British land, why would he condemn Russia shooting down a civilian plane?",4612,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,neu

Mosque is in Christchurch, NZ. It’s the third most populous city in the country. 

* Reliable Twitter reports from Christchurch Hospital employee suggest that at least [eight](https://twitter.com/makennedy101/status/1106365825030590464?s=21) people are injured.

* The Prime Minister of NZ has cancelled all her planned events for the afternoon in response to this event 

* [NZ Police](https://twitter.com/nzpolice/status/1106368186708979712?s=21) say they got reports of shots fired around 1:40 local time, advise residents to call 111 if they see suspicious activity. 

* Reports relating to the number of shots fired are in the range of 20-30. Injury count still a little uncertain. 

* Shooter was wearing a “military-style” jacket, around 300 people inside the mosque at the time —[RNZ News](https://twitter.com/rnz_news/status/1106369610788401152?s=21)

* Video going around suggests higher death toll possible.

* Local TV is saying **6 dead**. [Source](https://twitter.com/7newsadelaide/status/1106371395317989376?s=21)

* Reports of a second shooting at a different mosque in Linwood, NZ, a suburb of Christchurch. Second shooting reports are typical and usually false, so take this with a grain of salt. 

* Eyewitnesses suggesting the number shot may be in the dozens. 

* A Facebook video going around is showing the gunman’s stream of the event. Again, not going to link. The casualty toll is going to rise. 

* Shooter’s Twitter can be found online. Posted a series of manifestos. Not going to link or name him. If you want to see it you can find it. 

* [NZHerald](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;objectid=12213039) is saying that shootings occurred in mosques, as in the plural. Initial reports of dual shootings may be correct. A third shooting is also reported at Christchurch Hospital. 

* Hospital staff are expecting **40-50 injured** — [Source](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/111313238/shooting-at-christchurch-mosque)

* The Guardian is reporting that a bomb was found in a crashed car on Strickland Street in Christchurch, three kilometers from the attack. [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2019/mar/15/christchurch-shooting-injuries-reported-as-police-respond-to-critical-incident-live)

* Bangladeshi cricket team was either at or near the mosque, they are all reportedly safe.

* Situation remains active according to New Zealand Police. [[Twitter]](https://twitter.com/nzpolice/status/1106380367722737664?s=21) Reports of shots fired within past 10 minutes. 

* Picture is circulating of police surrounding a suspect on the ground, it can be seen on the NZ Herald [website](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;objectid=12213039).

* Same website as above states that **dozens are feared dead**.

* The report of a shooting at Christchurch Hospital appears to be **false**. 

* The report of a second shooting at a separate mosque in the suburb of Linwood seems to be **true**, according to local news reports. 

* Local media reporting **at least 9 dead**. The consensus from those who have seen the clips, and local media speculation, that number will almost certainly rise. 

* As of 4:10 NZDT, **New Zealand Police say they have a suspect in custody, shootings occurred at two mosques in Christchurch.** [Video](https://www.facebook.com/NZPolice/videos/397600961069896/)

* New Zealand Police are unsure if there are more suspects, only one person was featured in the video going around.

* New Zealand Police tell people not to go to any mosque today until the situation is clear.

* New Zealand Police say they ""believe there may be other offenders"" — [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nzpolice/status/1106391398020874241).

* ""This is and will be one of New Zealand's darkest days"" — NZ PM Jacinda Arden

* Twitter sources and a couple of local news reports have a higher death toll than what is currently being reported, going to wait till a more legitimate news source comments on it.

* I'll also be working on a [Reddit Live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/12m7drcwonnrt) but this will continue to be updated.

* [Link](https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1106391817656762368) to a map that shows the locations of the two mosques.

* Police briefing scheduled to occur at 5:00pm local time, 12:00am EST.

* As of 11:48pm EST and 4:48 NZDT, **At least 27 people are dead and dozens more are injured** according to the [Herald Sun](https://twitter.com/theheraldsun/status/1106400958349631494).

* New Zealand Police are aware of the footage and are working to delete it as best as they can. They further urge it **not** be shared. 

* As noted by a couple of individuals, the attack occurred during Jumu'ah, or Friday Prayer. Attendance is higher during this prayer.

I’m a young medicine attending making my rounds in the hospital; a code blue is called over head. I’m not on the code team that day (there’s a dedicated team for that), but I’m a hallway away and the code team is probably on the other side of the hospital.... i would hope that if my dad/mom were in the hospital dying and a code were called overhead, that a doc a few meters away would just show up rather than continue walking away (even if it weren’t “his job”), so i go in. We’re on a gen Med floor, there’s not a whole lot around. 

I walk in and anesthesia is already at the bedside with a young surgery resident; never a good sign at our hospital since anesthesiologists are rarely sighted outside the OR (we’re a very large hospital with a lot of other folks who usually respond to emergencies/do difficult intubations...anesthesia only comes for the really really bad ones). 

The patient is definitely not dead, but he looks like he’s about to be- his face is turning blue and he’s holding his neck gurgling, he is definitely losing his airway. This is a rapid response call, not a code (yet) since clearly his heart is still beating.  Surgery resident fills me in, patient had recent neck surgery and was about to be discharged when he suddenly started complaining of sudden difficulty breathing. Based on his neck size, he’s clearly bleeding into his neck space, so he called anesthesiologist and his chief - good move, but patient is now rapidly decompensating (hence the code call). We’re trying to bag him- not going well, lots of airway resistance. Anesthesiologist already wanted to intubate, meds are reportedly on the way stat from pharmacy, but we needed them yesterday. Guy is gasping, oxygen sats are dropping, running out of options. 

Surgery resident and i hold patient’s arms down. We tell him to stay calm and try to cooperate, we need to get the tube in now or you’re going to die. His eyes are panicked and wide, but he gives a quick nod. 

Anesthesiologist tries to intubate him while he’s awake, we’re out of time. Can’t see anything, patient retching and writhing. Typical, that’s why we usually need meds. Abort first attempt, O2 Sats are down in the 60-70s. RT starts bagging again, Surgery resident is calling trauma chief, he’s stuck in a surgery with attending (surgery doesn’t routinely come to codes), i got a hand on his pulse. Sats are back up to low 80s, anesthesiologist tries one more time- gets a view of the cords, but there’s too much swelling past the vocal cords and he can’t get the breathing tube through. 

By now patients face is a deep shade of purple and his heart rate is in the 50’s, this dude’s about to fuckin die. Bagging getting harder. I tell the surgery resident we need to prepare to do cricothyrotomy or something- this guy is going to be toast. First year critical care fellow shows up with the code team. Somehow still no meds here...it seems like an eternity, but it’s probably been <5 minutes at this point since all this started. Someone runs to the ICU to pull meds from a Pyxis machine, but that’s on the otherwise of the hospital, and these other meds are getting tubed over from the pharmacy which takes time....more than the 5 min we’ve already had.

Guy’s neck is huge now, we can’t bag anymore, still no meds, we’re beyond fucked here. Surgery intern is still the only surgeon here and the critical care fellow is new- no one has ever done a cric in this room. 

No time to worry about that- we have to make a move or he’s dead. Somehow this poor bastard is still conscious- we each take a limb (there’s a lot of people here now) and hold him down. Surgery resident cant find cricothyroid space- too much swelling, we just need to evacuate the hematoma. Patient loses consciousness. Surgery resident looks confidently terrified (I’m sure we all do), he fuckin bibs this guy to evacuate the hematoma and find cricothyroid space- suddenly he’s awake again and thrashing on the bed, me and three large dudes are struggling to restrain him. His eyes are so wide- panicking, crying. He’s trying to scream but he has no air to scream so it sounds like a raspy squeak. Those eyes man. I can still see him staring, pleading. There’s blood everywhere, whatever was bleeding was (or now is) arterial. Coming out in spurts. Critical care fellow gets a finger in and clamps what’s bleeding; hematoma evacuated. But this guy is super fat, there’s blood everywhere, and he is still moving- no way to safely do the cric, not now at least.

Meds from pharmacy getting in- somehow only succinylcholine (a medication for paralysis) here at the moment. No sedative or pain meds here yet. FUCK. 

Patient is going ballistic on the bed, can’t get a seal to try and bag, there’s blood everywhere. Sats still low, i can’t believe he hasn’t coded. I can’t believe he’s still conscious! Anesthesiologist orders to paralyze or he’s going to die just from inability to vent. He stops moving. Before we try cricothyrotomy with hematoma out, anesthesia wants to try and intubate again. Swelling less with hematoma out, he gets tube through. RN back from MICU, we have sedatives. Get the guy comfortable. Meds from pharmacy here. Sats are better, still bleeding like a stuck pig. We run him down to OR and vascular surgery meets us there, i leave him in the hands of my colleagues. 

All that happened in like 15 minutes or less. All this happened at about 9AM, i still had another 10 hours of my day left to pretend like i didn’t just see some guy get his throat slit while i held him down. 

Dude lived. Was very grateful. Remembered everything. I can still see his face as i held down his arms as they cut his throat to this day. I’m sure he has nightmares.

The point is this: if you work in medicine odds are you’ve been traumatized already, several times. I have a handful of fucked up stories just like this one, and I’ve only been practicing for 5 years. The difference with COVID is the added stress of self preservation and the threat to my family. That on top of the stress of people dying and not being with their families with the visitor ban has made it all the more difficult. But let’s not pretend like most of us weren’t already carrying some baggage, we just don’t talk about it.

The war will continue with or without the US. This war isn’t about the US and is more about religion, government corruption, and regional differences.

First off, I am a southern Yemeni so I have a different perspective of this war than the northern Yemenis.

Here goes, the north is densely populated and has a high consecration of people we call “Huthis” a different religious affliction than us, Sunnis, so they’ve been mostly neglected and treated badly by the government.

Furthermore, the Yemeni government heavily neglected the south Yemenis and took resources to pocket and better the life of northern cities, while letting Al Queda ravage the eastern side of southern Yemen.. The history is a bit long and complex but the short story is that the south wants to secede from the north to form its own democratic government. 

Saudi Arabia wants the “Huthis” to be under control since they don’t want Shai nation next to their borders and so they started funding the south to fight its war while the northern government neglects its people. 

Emirates was giving aid to the northern government and its people until it stopped and started funding the southern with weapons and car to combat the terrorist and Huthis. 

The war is very very complex and it seems like the nation of Yemen might not exist in a few years. But, don’t think the Yemeni government are innocent because it’s just as explicit in the death of its own citizens.

I'll try one more time as a top level comment - What the TPP actually does and why:


I did a couple hours of research a few months ago.  The best I could come up with from neutral sources was what I put below.  Read all of the bullet points though, because I didn't neatly separate this list into pros and cons (if you even can).

* It is an absurdly complicated subject, so take everything with a grain of salt.

* It would be like NAFTA was for mexico <--> US / Canada, but with a few major differences.  

* The first major difference, is that instead of targeting trade with Mexico, the point was to target trade with south east asia.

* The second major difference was that NAFTA targeted manufacturing jobs (in return for cheaper goods).  TPP targeted service level jobs, and was very explicit in which industries for which countries.

* For example, for the United States, jobs in nursing and retail work were specifically targeted and expected to be strongly adversely affected, in return for significantly expanded asian market penetration for things like American automotive exports and pharmaceuticals.

* How could something like nursing be exported?  Well, that actually gets to the heart of the matter.  For the United States, the point of the TPP (and its sister acts) was to greatly, greatly strengthen and enforce IP law for south east asia, to match already existing IP and trade law in the US and Europe.

* So whereas right now your bank probably hires American programmers, instead of programmers from Cambodia, for purely safety and enforcement reasons, that would change tomorrow.  And with the TPP, if you are a programmer, this would adversely affect you.  But nursing was specifically targeted, as bringing SE asia more in line with HIPAA guarantees would make it legally feasible to outsource more hospital overhead offshore.

* This all means you could expect major offshoring of what are right now considered reputable and secure jobs in America, and for the act to be quite transformative for the economy.  In short, if your job isn't tied to the USA, and is easy to offshore, but hasn't been for logistic, legal or economic reasons, the TPP almost certainly changed the math involved with that equation (though of course it will be different for every job / industry).

**Okay, so if America is trading away good jobs in entire industries, what does it get in return?**

* Right now, if you are a large business that wants to get into Asian markets, you have two problems.  1) If you open in China, there's a good chance your designs will be eventually be stolen and given to a Chinese company, which the Chinese government will then later support at your expense.  And 2) The rest of SE asia has similar problems to varying degrees, and they all trade with China.

* Additionally, right now Europe's economy is looking dead for the foreseeable future.  And since America isn't spending money jumpstarting our own economy, we're not likely to grow at a large rate any time soon either.

* But asian economies are booming.  And as they do so, they are trading with each other, and making trade deals with each other that don't include us.  And that's a major disadvantage for America and Europe.

* So the purpose of the TPP, from a western viewpoint, is to get SE asia into the same economic and legal framework as the western world, and open their markets to western companies.  

* The second purpose of the TPP, is to get China to play ball too.  Right now, if we tell China to open their markets, and enforce western IP law, they'll laugh in our face (and do so).  We don't have the bartering chips for that deal.  But if the rest of SE asia is already doing so with the West, and builds their economies around such laws, then 15-20 years from now, it won't just be Europe / USA telling China to open their markets and enforce international IP law, it will be the vast majority of China's trading partners.  In short, it would be an economic coup d'etat for western powers, that would bring a _lot_ of money to large western companies and give Washington much more power in Asia.  If you are a citizen of the west, this is almost certainly a good thing.

* So Obama and Clinton's bet, is that if we don't make a deal like the TPP, then Chinese (and by extension SE asian) companies are going to spring up as international competitors to American firms anyway.  And that increased competition represents lost profits that could otherwise have been made by western companies trading in China.  So by trading those jobs to outsourcing now, the US would be in a much more dominant position later, and it is worth the trade.

**Okay, is that line of thinking valid?**

Yes and No.

* If you are a CEO, or a powerful washington person.  Then yes, unequivocally.  The TPP means continued western and American worldwide economic hegemony and should be strongly fought for.  EU / USA firms cannot do business in China.  That's a major economic disadvantage for any western firm playing on that level.

* For people who's jobs are not offshored, then yes, this is probably a good plan.  Just like NAFTA resulted in cheaper goods, TPP should result in cheaper services across the board.  

* But if your job can be offshored (and the list of offshorable jobs the TPP will make cost effective to offshore is large), then it is more complicated.

* If the USA had a real economic safety net, and put forward programs towards retraining and revitalizing areas specifically hit by offshoring and globalization, then you could vote for the TPP confidently.  This, for example is how the scandanavian countries handled integration into the EU, and overall there are very few cases of real economic hardship as the result of that integration.  Overall, it was a success story.

* But after NAFTA, the USA implemented no such programs, whatsoever.  Economists at the time, believed them to be unnecessary.  The thinking was, that if free trade agreements resulted in more trade, which resulted in more jobs, then people who lost their jobs to outsourcing should have no difficulty finding new jobs in a free market.

* The reality was that outsourcing resulted in chain effects whereby entire regions of the country lost all their good jobs, and the good jobs that remained moved to other US locations.  Combined with the fact that many people woke up one day to find that their entire career was no longer employable in their home country, meant that they simply could not find new work.  Add in again Greenspan's attempts to 'lower worker mobility to increase American labor competitiveness', and the end result is that today, in 2017, many families that lost their jobs due to nafta STILL are not employed.

So at the end of the day, you have to make a call.  Do you think that America will be like Scandanavia, and reinvest a portion of the profits reaped by greater access to Asian markets on economic growth, unemployment benefits, worker retraining and government programs?  Or do you think that America will call those things socialism, ignore the problem, and allow large companies to reap the economic rewards unmolested?

Personally, I fall into the second category, so I am very, very happy to see the TPP fail.  I think that given the second viewpoint, outsourcing service level jobs, in THIS economy, would be a death sentence for many, many people.  But that said, if you think that the first option is a possibility, then the TPP should be strongly supported.  And really, in an ideal world, if we could trust that America would take care of the people who would be harmed by the outsourcing, then we would want the TPP to pass, because increased trade and American competitiveness in the future is something that should be encouraged and worked towards.",22002,"Good job Mr. President.

Now in his last year in office, Cárdenas put forth perhaps his most progressive reform yet. Full decriminalization of all drugs. Addicts were given prescriptions at 1/20th of the street cost, and their rehabilitation was overseen by physicians and pharmacists. Killing criminals' profits while also treating addiction as the disease that it is.



Unfortunately, six months later Mexico was forced to repeal the law due to a threat of a pharmaceutical boycott by the US Government.

We can't keep consuming the amounts we do, we can't keep generating the waste we generate, especially if we aren't willing to deal with that waste ourselves, and reducing our consumption will hit the economy no matter what.

Turns out, everything was made in China and the company just changed the label to ""made in the USA"". They just import these cameras from multiple chinese companies. Here's the part that gets really interesting. Aventura made most of its money selling to NY and Federal agencies. The only reason this whole fraud was discovered was because a security personnel in one of the Air force bases that had these cameras saw Chinese words on the screen for a brief second. And it turns out, the air force, the army and most scary multiple Aircraft carriers all had Aventura cameras installed. What's troubling is that the Chinese companies had the logos on the cameras changed to reflect the US militaries logo, to evade suspension. So they weren't just sell cameras to Aventura, they knew where the camera were being installed.

On a side note, Aventura was able to get these military contracts because it claimed to be owned and ran by majority women. The Pentagon sets aside money each year to give contracts out for these types businesses. Aventura in fact was ran by A man, but he used his wifes signature on all legal docs and had her communicate with potential govt procurement agents. The FBI monitored her, and throughout most of these times that she was supposed to be working at Aventura, she was actually working at a accounting firm.

To begin with let’s put things in in perspective, and before people ask - I am a British ex-pat who has lived in Spain for 3 years.

We were informed time and time again over the past 18 months by the British Consulate, the UK Government, the Spanish Government, even the Citizens Advice Bureau in Spain that Brits who wanted to stay should get their paperwork up to date and gain  official residency before 31 Dec 2020. Some lazy fellow brits just stuck their heads in the sand and left things to the last minute or not at all. All I can say is tough luck. Spain are not throwing Brits out they are deporting ‘Illegal’ immigrants in the same way Britain will deport illegal Spanish immigrants after BREXIT. Do some Brits feel they have a god given right to stay wherever they want?

I have found Spain to be an amazingly welcoming country with friendly people. But to be clear, I am a guest with permanent residency in their country and act as such, in the same way the British expect legal guest immigrants to respect Britain, its laws and customs. 

Former ex-pats that meet the residency requirements can reapply anytime, unless they remain in the country illegally.

Due to the global spread of these programmes, it has meant that there is a worldwide understanding that non-recyclable plastic has an extremely negative impact, especially on marine life.

Unfortunately, palm oil is found in a variety of products, ranging from candy bars to toothpaste to makeup, and rarely is it clearly labeled. In fact, there are more than 170 different names that manufacturers use on their packaging to avoid saying the words “palm oil."" That may make purging palm oil products from your cabinets and shopping list sound overwhelming, but I’ve rounded up some easy tips for doing so — ones that don’t include memorizing all 170 names.

Here are six reliable ways to avoid palm oil:
1.The most common name palm oil is disguised under is “vegetable oil.”
2.Most prepackaged snack foods made by corporate giants (Nestle, Unilever, etc.) contain palm oil.
3.If a product's saturated fat content makes up more than 40 percent of its total fat content, it will almost always contain palm oil.
4.Ingredients with the word ""palm"" in them are palm oil or are derived from the oil palm fruit.
5.If you’re not sure whether a product contains palm oil, either type the product name into your search engine along with ""palm oil"" and scan the search results, or contact the company and ask if they use palm oil.
6.To avoid palm oil, choose products that contain clearly labeled oils, such as 100 percent sunflower oil, corn oil, olive oil, coconut oil, or canola oil.

Calling for immediate apology for threats against Czech Republic.

Esteemed,

this was the last time you opened your mouth about CR! Your behavior have substantially crossed the lines of what is diplomatically acceptable. You dare to threaten senate chairman with pay heavy price, you unmannered rude clowns!

Now listen to me, comrade minister. PRC will apologize asap for the shameless threat. And when I say asap, I mean right now! I want to have it in 24 hours on the table of Czech foreign minister. Btw, he agrees with me, but has to keep his mouth shut because of pact of not very sane mercenary Miloš Zeman with our premier, co-conspirator Babiš. But that doesn't mean you will bully us like this.

Be ashamed and acknowledge that in future even a tone which would implicate threat towards representatives of our sovereign country I will make you pay a heavy price for bullying, and you won't like it. You will not train us from position of strength and I warn you that reaction from our side will be same even if you had invested 14x more than our friends from Taiwan instead of 14x less.

Wake up. You will not shit on us. Do not let this to be repeated.

Send me the copy of the apology on email, so I can put it in archives and forget your pathetic diplomatic fuck up you have just made. Don't piss me off.

With pretending regards.

Serious [flames clearly visible on the roof above the apse](https://twitter.com/Dalrymple/status/1117840646281150468). Does not look good.

**7:30 Paris Time**: [Reuters reporting the fire is](https://twitter.com/BakerLuke/status/1117839884880949248) indeed related to ongoing work on the roof.

**7:45 Paris Time**: [The fire has spread to the roofs of both transepts](https://imgur.com/a/Khy4TmJ) and has fully engulfed the spire. [Here is a look from the side at the progress the fire is making](https://twitter.com/DavisDunham/status/1117848314324475911) along the roof towards the nave. According to wikipedia, [there is a water reservoir between the two towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris#Towers_and_the_Spire), although with the fire burning from the other end that can likely only buy time.

**8:00 Paris Time**: [The spire and the roof of the Apse have both collapsed](https://twitter.com/MyMeraphetamine/status/1117848028570767360) :(

[Here is the moment](https://twitter.com/gullyburrows93/status/1117849521193533440) the spire fell.

**8:05 [Paris](https://www.tripsnek.com) Time**: [The roof of the nave](https://twitter.com/andysmithy/status/1117850380724068352) no longer exists, the fire has reached the front towers.

**8:30 [Paris](https://www.tripsnek.com) Time**: [The fire is raging in the interior](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D4NufqlX4AAWNqa.jpg:large). It is very difficult to see how much of anything that is not stone survives this. There are no reported injuries, but this is looking like a worst case scenario for the structure itself :(

**10:00 [Paris](https://www.tripsnek.com) Time**: Nicolas Delesalle from Paris Match [is reporting that all works of art](https://twitter.com/KoliaDelesalle/status/1117865987670364160), the treasury, and relics have been safely evacuated.

**10:15 Paris Time**: The French Interior Minister is warning that the cathedral [may be beyond saving](https://apnews.com/73404d09773740f699d4b92933abec50?utm_source=Twitter&utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_medium=AP). The drone view [from the top](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D4OHvvTWwAINUJf.jpg) shows that the cathedral interior appears to be engulfed. Focus is now on the two bell towers. I have not seen any word on the fate of the [north rose window](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/North_Rose_Window_in_Notre_Dame%2C_2013.jpg) between them. ~~The other rose windows have been lost.~~

**11:00 Paris Time**: Paris fire officials are asserting that [the main structure has been ""saved and preserved""](https://twitter.com/BBCBreaking/status/1117896882406055936) from ""total destruction"".

**1:00 AM Paris Time**: The Cathedral stands. This includes, amazingly given the videos and images before, [most of the stone vaulted ceiling](https://twitter.com/TitanicKyle/status/1117926588652371968). The outer roof burned entirely. The interior was not totally destroyed.

**8:30 AM Paris Time**: Just in case anyone sees this, the pictures [in the morning are a significant improvement](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D4QKGCeW0AACv3s?format=jpg&name=large) over the carnage last night. It looks like one of the rose windows may have even survived.

**Final Update** [Reporting now](https://mobile.twitter.com/BFMParis/status/1118053630127558658) is that the organ and all three of the Rose windows (widely reported as having ""exploded"" last night) survived! However, also in contradiction with reporting from yesterday, the fate of some relics, paintings and treasures is unclear, although the fact that pews and other wooden furnishing are intact in the nave has to be encouraging. The main damage will be to the area around where the steeple collapsed through the roof.

To get an idea of how such a horrifying-looking conflagration left so much of the structure unharmed, [this article from Madrid's El Pais](https://elpais.com/cultura/2019/04/15/actualidad/1555356902_708073.html) has some excellent visualizations of the architecture interspersed with pictures of the fire.

It was a Boeing 737-8KV, registration UR-PSR. It was delivered new to Ukrainian Air 3.6 years ago. FYI this was the older generation of 737, obviously not the MAX, as those are still grounded. 

The plane took off from Tehran with callsign Alpha-Uniform-India-7-5-2 at 6:12am local time, almost an hour after the 5:15am scheduled departure. 

The FR24 playback of the transponder shows the plane climbing up to about 8,000ft and then.... nothing:

Let me propose a situation, you as TikTok silo off an GPS area, let's say an international school. You immediately know that the kids are rich or are diplomat kids. You can then immediately cross reference their data and within a short period of time you know who their friends are, who their contacts are. You can then workout their parents phone numbers, then with your infiltrated 5G Networks (I sound like a conspiracy theorist) you can drop in on the diplomats phone conversations or whatever. It also opens up the kids for social engineering and blackmail. Kids are stupid and will probably sext each other, bam you have blackmail.  The kids will also make TikToks walking around their house. However they may always avoid a room (secure room or parents bedroom), bam you know where the juicy stuff happens. You could also activate the microphone and listen in on dinner conversations, where mum or dad diplomat criticises someone else. Or if diplomat parent has TikTok to check in on their kids they microphone can then listen in on other conversations. You might use a seperate secure cell phone for work, but that means nothing if your non secure phone is next to it sucking up all the audio and telemetry.

1. He was an intoxicated passenger.
2. Police were dealing with his wife, the driver of the vehicle.
3. He got out of the vehicle and started harassing the officers, including but not limited to threatening them.

There are a bunch of other details such as the car was recently taken out of impound due to the car being reported stolen by his daughter and recovered, and other things. But really I think these three points give us a good idea of the context (and these are as reported by the chief).

"" Chief Adam said the incident happened in the early hours of March 10, when he, his wife and his niece left the Boomtown Casino.

"" - This is the Chief indicating that his wife was DD, perhaps many of you are correct in saying it wasn't clear if he was intoxicated I was perhaps reading the between the lines. Could have been either way, who knows.

"" Chief Adam said he did not realize the licence plate and registration of his truck had expired on Jan. 31. He had just picked it up from the police pound, where it had been for 60 days after his daughter was stopped for driving without a licence and Chief Adam had reported it stolen.

"" “I am watching this whole thing and I say, ‘Hey wait a minute, stop.’ And he looked at me and he said, ‘Get back.’ He told me to get back. I said, ‘No way. You let my wife go right now. If not, you will get it,' I told him. "" - from the Chief himself

For the record I only wanted to give context to the bandwagon of hatred, both ways. Canada has a bad history of systemic racism that we continue to fight each day, but that also does not mean every situation is due to racism and not every act of violence is police brutality.

Edit:

I'm a kiwi, and the view of the office and street is that these kind of changes are completely reasonable and ordinary.

Anyway, the vast majority of firearms sold and used in NZ are your bolt-action rifles for hunting and pump-action shotguns for pest control so it doesn't really change much. It gets a bit murky though because you can still purchase low-capacity .22 semi-autos on a normal A-cat ticket but the range has been severely restricted now.",5268,"Americans need to understand not every country has their gun culture, and no other countries consider gun ownership a condituational right.

About two years ago he came to my country, Romania, on some PR stunt, and set up an interview with one of the top national newspapers, Adevarul. The journalist interviewing him had balls and asked him about the famous Trump pussy comment, to which he replied something along the lines of ""it was brilliant"". 

He realized how that sounded later and pulled some strings with Adevarul's ownership to have that bit removed from the interview. The journalist didn't want to budge, however, and made the whole thing public, including a call with his editor in chief blatantly telling him that it was a request from Stone directly. In retribution, instead of firing him so that he could sue for severance, they shut down his entire section (video journalism) so they could have a legal reason to lay him off. They then went on to publish the edited version of interview anyway. It's hard to describe how angry I get whenever I remember that. 

Edit: For all those requesting sources, here's the part of the interview which was cut out and led to the situation https://streamable.com/ryui5

Regarding him being fired by the newspaper, I will try to find some sources later, it's a bit hard because it was only reported in Romania and even then mostly by independent journalists/NGO's.

Edit 2: Also check u/cuza's comments in the replies for some sources in Romanian.

Edit 3: Just to clear some speculation from the replies, the video journalism section had two other employees I think, which were temporarily moved to other sections until they could get the interviewer off the books. That being said, it was still an incredibly shitty way of dealing with the situation. [Here's a more detailed explanation of the events from Vice Romania](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=ro&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fro%2Farticle%2Fvbmzzj%2Fmomentele-din-presa-din-romania-cand-jurnalistii-s-au-plans-ca-sunt-cenzurati-de-sefii-lor), including the fact that the journalist, Mircea Barbu, streamed a sit-in at the newsroom while waiting for his termination, for which Adevarul's deputy editor-in-chief threatened to beat him.

Edit 4: [An interview with the journalist in question subtitled in English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwQQWpyDV5w&feature=youtu.be), courtesy again of u/cuza

Edit 5: [The recording of the phone call in which Adevarul's editor-in-chief, Dan Marinescu, requested the journalist to remove the question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijV-tYUMyIo) It's in Romanian and I don't have time to translate all of it, but the part where he mentions Stone's requests is at 0:53.

> Zimbabwe has made it illegal for schools to expel pupils who get pregnant, a measure women&#039;s rights campaigners said would help tackle gender inequality in the classroom and stop many girls from dropping out of school.

> Many parents of pregnant girls, or the girls themselves, decide to quit schooling due to the pregnancy, and schools do not always do enough to encourage them to stay, officials say.

> Pregnancy is just one of the reasons that girls in Zimbabwe could fail to return to classes after coronavirus restrictions are lifted, said Sibusisiwe Ndlovu, communications specialist at Plan International Zimbabwe.

Now *thats* a claim that has some validity to it",4982,"Here he is representing the country at the G7: 


“The hosts were upset when the president arrived late. Trump berated other leaders about “unfair trade practices.” 

He grew irritated with Japanese prime minister Shinzō Abe, at one point apparently telling him in a meeting: “Shinzō, you don’t have this problem [of illegal immigration], but I can send you twenty-five million Mexicans and you’ll be out of office very soon.” He tossed Starburst candy at German chancellor Angela Merkel, remarking, “Here, Angela. Don’t say I never give you anything.” And then he left the summit early, rounding off the visit with a tweetstorm blasting Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau as “so meek and mild…very dishonest & weak,” and announcing that the United States was backing out of the joint statement signed only hours earlier with the other leaders.


What a horrible mess, I thought. This isn’t how we’d act toward our enemies at an international summit, and these were our close friends. Not only that, we’d wasted an opportunity to show solidarity with them on important issues where we had common interests. Perhaps worst of all, the president alarmed everyone at the summit by publicly calling for a nation-state rival, Russia, to be readmitted into the G7 meetings. Russia had been cast out of the group over its invasion of Crimea. Since then, Vladimir Putin had done little to demonstrate he was a responsible world partner, but the president questioned why the allies should meet at all if Moscow wasn’t invited. It was as if Putin himself had written Trump’s talking points.


In any event, Trump didn’t care about the tiny trail of destruction he left on the way out of Canada. His mind was elsewhere. He was flying to make new friends, on the other side of the world. The G7 was merely a distraction standing in the way of the month’s main event: his meeting with Kim Jong Un, the brutal dictator of North Korea. Trump would later reveal it was the meeting where he and Kim “fell in love.”

I Have some insight into what's going on here. I'm not ""victim blaming"" or blindly support Trump here but, this is a problem with both Puerto Rico, and Federal law.

An ""Incident"" (blanket term for both Natural and, Man-made disasters) is managed at the lowest possible level. So, If this was a disaster in your county, your county government would manage it, and ask your state government for help. Your state would then ask FEMA for help if it needed additional resources and funding. This is how the Law deams it to work and, how it usually works out best.

It's part of the changes that came about after Katrina. It used to be that once the state asked for help, FEMA took a bigger leadership role. The main problem with that model is, FEMA personnel from other parts of the country are clueless about your community. They don't know what resources you have, their capabilities or, have working relationships with them. FEMA personnel also face a huge learning curve when dealing with the makeup of the the residents and the potential dangers of the local industries. 

It's the local cops, firefighters and emergency managers that know the critical needs of their communities and it's why that shift in leadership was made.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/16/health/puerto-rico-hospital-ship/index.html

>According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the official protocol is for patients in need to go to their nearest medical facility. If that facility is unable to provide care, a doctor there should contact the medical coordinating center in San Juan.

>Someone there will then determine whether a patient needs to be transferred to a hospital on the island and which one. In some cases, a determination will be made to transfer a patient to the US Army Combat Support Hospital in Humacao, which has 44 beds and has been operational since Sunday. The remaining option is for patients to be transferred to the Comfort.

>""Only patients with critical needs requiring specialized care will be transferred to USNS Comfort,"" said Coast Guard Lt. David Connor in an email. He is working at the FEMA Joint Information Center in San Juan. 

>""The disconnect or the apparent disconnect was in the communications flow,"" Rosselló said.

>He acknowledged that the system must get better.

>""I asked for a complete revision of that so that we can now start sending more patients over there,"" Rosselló said.

Puerto Rico, just as every other state and territory of the U.S., is required to have an Emergency Management agency or, task an existing agency (Dept. of Health, State Police equivalent, etc...) with the authority and the responsability, to plan for and be able to function in a disaster such as this. It looks like PR's government is failing it's people as much as the Feds are.

**TL;DR: The U.S. response could has been quicker, Americans are suffering but, Puerto Rico's government has dropped the ball it this case and, it's illegal for FEMA to come in and take over.**

This is actually NASA climatologist [Dr James Hansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hansen)’s top [recommendation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAW1A6Ca8) on climate change.  A small but [growing movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitizensClimateLobby/comments/k49dbv/citizens_climate_lobby_experienced_some_really/) has been building momentum toward passing carbon pricing and other climate legislation recently:

2015: 17 US Republican Congressmen cosponsored a[ resolution](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-resolution/424/text) acknowledging climate change and calling for solutions.

2016: A bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in the US House of Representatives was formed, eventually reaching a peak of 45 Republicans and 45 Democrats in 2018.

2018: Canada [passed](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/canada-adopts-carbon-fee-and-dividend-to-rein-in-climate-change/) a national carbon price, and [doubled down](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/canada-ramps-up-its-carbon-price-moves-to-quarterly-dividends/) in 2020.

2019: A bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in the US Senate is formed, and has now grown to 7 Republicans, 6 Democrats and 1 Independent.

2020: There are a bunch of bipartisan climate bills in the US Congress, with both Rs and Ds cosponsoring. *Update December 2020: Some of these bipartisan climate bills are*[ *passing*](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/three-of-ccls-lobbying-asks-pass-congress-will-become-law/)*.* 

r/ClimateOffensive",1064,"> The richest 10% of the global population accounted for 52% of the carbon emissions added to the atmosphere between 1990 and 2015 – depleting by around a third the total amount of carbon that can be added if global heating is to be kept within the 1.5C° goal of the Paris Agreement. The richest 1% were responsible for 15% of emissions during this time – more than twice as much as the poorest half of humanity.

It's important to remember that even though you aren't part of the top 1%, you are still contributing to climate change more than the average human if you live in a developed country. To understand why the comparison in the article sucks, check out [this fancy graph](https://i.imgur.com/VJuelFj.png) from [this report](https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10546/621052/mb-confronting-carbon-inequality-210920-en.pdf). 


Obviously poor people and people living in developing nations don't pollute as much, and they'll always pollute less than everyone else. Partially this is because their lifestyle doesn't require pollution, and partially because they can't *afford* polluting products. As we fight poverty, these people will get a richer, reach a higher standard of living, and start polluting (either by conventional means such as cars, using energy for heating/cooling or by consuming more electronics that demand huge amounts of energy to be produced). Focusing on the 1% is misguided (albeit deserved), because even if they'd have zero pollution the bulk of total climate change is still the *average population in developed nations*. As mentioned earlier, *this part is going to grow significantly as poverty is reduced worldwide*. 

The take-away from this report shouldn't be ""The 1% pollutes a lot"", they definitely do, but the take-away should be that carbon emissions and wealth are intricately connected, and we need to fight pollution and overconsumption on all wealth levels if we want to fight climate change *and* still manage to increase standards of living worldwide.",585,0.196,0.804,0.0,-0.631,neg

It's crazy that despite this, the President is *already directly implicated in two felonies* brought forward by a separate investigation for completely separate reasons.

Trump is an undeniable criminal, and most likely a traitor to America. The fact that he has 42% approval right now will be one of the most puzzling statistics our children or grandchildren will ever have to learn in history class. I have no idea how I will explain it to them.",9576,"Sorry for the paywall. This story seems to be breaking right now by the Times. Here's the full text:  
  
WASHINGTON — In the days after President Trump fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, law enforcement officials became so concerned by the president’s behavior that they began investigating whether he had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests, according to former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.

The inquiry carried explosive implications. Counterintelligence investigators had to consider whether the president’s own actions constituted a possible threat to national security. Agents also sought to determine whether Mr. Trump was knowingly working for Russia or had unwittingly fallen under Moscow’s influence.

The investigation the F.B.I. opened into Mr. Trump also had a criminal aspect, which has long been publicly known: whether his firing of Mr. Comey constituted obstruction of justice.

Agents and senior F.B.I. officials had grown suspicious of Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign but held off on opening an investigation into him, the people said, in part because they were uncertain how to proceed with an inquiry of such sensitivity and magnitude. But the president’s activities before and after Mr. Comey’s firing in May 2017, particularly two instances in which Mr. Trump tied the Comey dismissal to the Russia investigation, helped prompt the counterintelligence aspect of the inquiry, the people said.

The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, took over the inquiry into Mr. Trump when he was appointed, days after F.B.I. officials opened it. That inquiry is part of Mr. Mueller’s broader examination of how Russian operatives interfered in the 2016 election and whether any Trump associates conspired with them. It is unclear whether Mr. Mueller is still pursuing the counterintelligence matter, and some former law enforcement officials outside the investigation have questioned whether agents overstepped in opening it.

The criminal and counterintelligence elements were coupled together into one investigation, former law enforcement officials said in interviews in recent weeks, because if Mr. Trump had ousted the head of the F.B.I. to impede or even end the Russia investigation, that was both a possible crime and a national security concern. The F.B.I.’s counterintelligence division handles national security matters.

If the president had fired Mr. Comey to stop the Russia investigation, the action would have been a national security issue because it naturally would have hurt the bureau’s effort to learn how Moscow interfered in the 2016 election and whether any Americans were involved, according to James A. Baker, who served as F.B.I. general counsel until late 2017. He privately testified in October before House investigators who were examining the F.B.I.’s handling of the full Russia inquiry.


“Not only would it be an issue of obstructing an investigation, but the obstruction itself would hurt our ability to figure out what the Russians had done, and that is what would be the threat to national security,” Mr. Baker said in his testimony, portions of which were read to The New York Times. Mr. Baker did not explicitly acknowledge the existence of the investigation of Mr. Trump to congressional investigators.

No evidence has emerged publicly that Mr. Trump was secretly in contact with or took direction from Russian government officials. An F.B.I. spokeswoman and a spokesman for the special counsel’s office both declined to comment.

Rudolph W. Giuliani, a lawyer for the president, sought to play down the significance of the investigation. “The fact that it goes back a year and a half and nothing came of it that showed a breach of national security means they found nothing,” Mr. Giuliani said on Friday, though he acknowledged that he had no insight into the inquiry.

The cloud of the Russia investigation has hung over Mr. Trump since even before he took office, though he has long vigorously denied any illicit connection to Moscow. The obstruction inquiry, revealed by The Washington Post a few weeks after Mr. Mueller was appointed, represented a direct threat that he was unable to simply brush off as an overzealous examination of a handful of advisers. But few details have been made public about the counterintelligence aspect of the investigation.

The decision to investigate Mr. Trump himself was an aggressive move by F.B.I. officials who were confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Mr. Comey and enduring the president’s verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a “witch hunt.”

A vigorous debate has taken shape among some former law enforcement officials outside the case over whether F.B.I. investigators overreacted in opening the counterintelligence inquiry during a tumultuous period at the Justice Department. Other former officials noted that those critics were not privy to all of the evidence and argued that sitting on it would have been an abdication of duty.

The F.B.I. conducts two types of inquiries, criminal and counterintelligence investigations. Unlike criminal investigations, which are typically aimed at solving a crime and can result in arrests and convictions, counterintelligence inquiries are generally fact-finding missions to understand what a foreign power is doing and to stop any anti-American activity, like thefts of United States government secrets or covert efforts to influence policy. In most cases, the investigations are carried out quietly, sometimes for years. Often, they result in no arrests.",7199,If national security is even in question how have impeachment proceedings not begun.

Fuck, man, 2020 has been a mess.",21181,"Nobody here is discussing it, but the explanation given for the shootdown is interesting. It broadly makes sense, but after reading the report itself there are some pretty big unanswered questions. 

The main one is this: if the missile battery's internal compass was not calibrated correctly, and it showed the plane coming from an angle 107 degrees off true, it should have done the same for every other plane taking off from Tehran that night. So why was PS752 shot down? Why not whatever plane took off 5 minutes earlier? 10 minutes?

There are possible ways to explain this. Was the missile battery moved into that position only minutes before the flight took off? Was there a shift change and this was the first flight from Tehran for the new shift, and the problem with the compass had not been passed on? But that's just speculation. If Iran doesn't eventually fill these gaps, we have no choice but to question the entire explanation. I hope we eventually get to know, but I'm not holding my breath.

EDIT: According to flightradar24 data, the last plane to take off from that runway was 30 minutes prior to flight PS752.

As public armies pull out of warzones, powerful governments are starting to hire contractors to do the dirty work of war, a dead contractor doesn’t get marked in a national tomb, they aren’t even a statistic, politicians don’t care about them as their deaths don’t sadden their constituents, they are more efficient and disposable, and they are becoming more numerous. ~~The sad truth is that crimes committed by private armies are not as extensively covered as their public counterparts, meaning that mass murder often goes unnoticed. Can you honestly tell me you’ve heard of this Iraq incident before today? Because I sure as hell haven’t.~~

It’s not just the US. Why do you think nations like Russia have put more trust in private mercenaries like Wagner to commence operations carrying out Putin’s interests in countries such as Libya & Syria?

You may think Trump pulling out troops in places like Somalia, Iraq, and Afghanistan is a good thing, but the same areas he pulls troops out of are the same areas private contractors coincidentally run amok.

Betsy DeVos, a Trump admin, is a sibling to Blackwater’s Erik Prince. Blackwater is one of the largest private military groups in the world and extensively takes US contracts and has been making a steady comeback since Trump took office. The same soldiers he pardoned worked for Blackwater, maybe he let them free for a reason?

The top most watched English news channel, Republic TV called the rape case a tale of fiction and defended the rapists.

>According to Seema Kushwala, the family’s lawyer, advocate Munna Singh Pundhir, representing the accused, began passing vulgar comments while the evidence was being presented. She said: “When Asha’s underwear was taken out, the defense lawyer and others began laughing and saying, ‘Yes, please take a good look at these panties.'

>The moment he walked in, he began shouting at me,” the brother said. “I could smell the alcohol on his breath.”
Kushwaha tried to tell Tarun to “back off” as he was intimidating the brother and interrupting the hearing. However, Tarun was joined by his father Hari Sharma, also an advocate, who also began yelling at Kushwaha and Asha’s brother, saying this was a case of honour killing and not rape

>More lawyers entered the courtroom and joined the Sharmas in verbally abusing and threatening Kushwaha and Asha’s family.

>“They started aggressively coming towards me and said I must remain within my limits,” Kushwaha said. “They started laughing and saying, ‘Let’s see how you come to Hathras next time.’ Asha’s brother was on my left and I could see him shaking and getting very scared.”
Judge BD Bharati then adjourned the hearing for lunch. “The judge himself seemed scared of these men,” said Asha’s brother. “He just kept folding his hands in front of them and requested them to leave.”

It covers the physics of how these things happen, explains the difference between crowd crush and crowd collapse, explains how people die and gives some tips that can improve your chances of recognizing and escaping similar situations.",17371,"For those wondering how this could happen: small alleyway in Itaewon, which is the hottest alley in the hottest neighborhood known for partying and clubbing in Korea. Its also famous for crazy parties during Halloween, and this was the first maskless party after Covid19 so a lot of people gathered in Itaewon (more than 100,000 people gathered in a small neighborhood in Korea for the Halloween weekend).

Edit: It was initially reported that the actual crowd crush was triggered by people swarming to a bar to see a celebrity, but none of it is proven as of yet. The consensus now is that the alleyway was too small, was a three-way alley with really terrible foot traffic, and the calls for help were silenced by the loud music from nearby clubs. The alleyway is also at an angle, making it easier for people to trip & fall thereby creating a human chokepoint, and people being pushed from behind could have easily piled up due to the angle. 

What a horrible, horrible case of crowd crush. People were literally being crushed to death. Suffocating while standing up, and trampled by layers of people. 

I’m adding links to video of the tragedy. Be warned, it is very disturbing and morbid. Also, if you are highly sensitive to other people’s pain this is going to be hard to watch:

You can't stop people doing something by making it illegal. As the UN rightly say, you just make it more dangerous. That might put some off, but it won't detract everyone.

Edit: getting a lot of ""that's a pro gun argument"" comments and I don't see how it is. Guns are weapons not a part of your body nor are they a necessary commodity. Owning a gun, or anything for that matter, and getting an abortion are two completely separate concepts.

Making guns illegal wouldn't totally eradicate gun crime, that's not the argument anyone is making as black market weapons still exist. However if the rest of the world is any kind of case study, it would MASSIVELY reduce gun crime on a national scale.

Making abortions illegal wouldn't mean that women need to get their tubes tide. You can't stop teenagers being stupid and having unprotected sex.

The title isn't sufficient to get the complete info.

He came to India in the first week of march from Germany (via Italy). Since India issued travel advisory guidelines and quarantine to Italy (Germany wasn't in the list) on the 2nd of march, it's entirely possible that he wasn't even told to quarantine. The festival he attended in India was on 10th March, and he died on 19th. His death was ruled as heart failure so he had non-respiratory symptoms and he was tested posthumously as covid-19 positive only since he had travel history.

We do not have enough info to even know if he was being careless, let alone an intentional spreader. Among the list of people he transmitted to is his 2 year old grand kid, I don't think anyone would be careless about this if he was told about the possibility of this infection.

EDIT : Since I'm from Punjab, most of what I wrote is what the local news coverage told us and what I heard around. However, I am being informed by people living much closer that he did get respiratory symptoms, went to a private hospital who recommended him to get tested and ignored that advice and THEN went on to the festival. While this also could be a local rumor, but from this new bit of info - there's a chance this man may have been guilty of risking the lives of others after all.

if actually having Covid doesn't give you antibodies, or those antibodies don't last very long, how is the vaccine going to be more effective?",7673,"I'll preface this by saying that I am not a proponent of the no intervention/herd immunity approach. I think vaccines are what'll help us get out of this situation and flattening the curve in the mean time is the way to go. 

That being said, I'm not sure the article or the study cited make a good point as to why herd immunity cannot be achieved. In Wuhan, the virus was contained and essentially eliminated by very strong lockdown measures, to the point that COVID-19 clinical trials had to be prematurely stopped due to a lack of patients to enroll way back in April. Though Wuhan was hard hit, I don't think a significant proportion of the population was infected in the first place. It's not too surprising that their antibody tests are coming back positive in such a small proportion.

Another thing to consider is that the antibody tests used generally have very poor sensitivity and specificity. This may contribute to the low proportion of seropositivity they report.

As to the claim that antibodies wane over time, that also seems to be an artifact of antibody tests with poor test characteristics. Several recent studies using more sensitive and specific methods (including this one https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7554472/) show that neutralizing antibodies persist in nearly all cases of COVID infections, including asymptomatic ones, up to a follow up of 226 days (COVID hasn't been around for a longer follow-up to be possible). The reports of reinfections with COVID that have survived peer review can pretty much be counted on one hand. It seems that an infection with COVID does confer lasting immunity, and that makes it all the more likely vaccines will work.",1836,"But their bodies now can quickly produce antibodies spcific for covid... if you test yourself for polio, you wont have antibodies either.

Some futures contracts ""settle to cash"" which means we determine the price when I bought the contract and the actual real world price on the day of expiration, then one of us pays the other person on the contract the cash difference. Easy. 

But oil and most commodity contracts actually settle for the actual product. If you don't close out your soybean contract, you get a call from the exchange telling you that your soybeans are waiting for you in Kansas City and what would you like to do with them?!  

Same with oil. Tankers are showing up in houston with millions of gallons of oil and somebody needs to take delivery.  Nobody can because all the storage facilities are already full. So people are literally paying you over $30 a barrel for you to take possession of oil. Crazy times.   

Edit: This specific contract is for specific delivery to an oil pipeline in Oklahoma, tomorrow. That is the crux of the issue.

Four people tested positive. The outbreak is in one family. The first case was a man in his 50s, who had symptoms for five days and then tested positive after being tested yesterday. The man has no history of overseas travel.

The city where the outbreak happened, Auckland, will go into alert level 3 at noon tomorrow. That means that schools, bars, cafes, resturaunts etc. will be shut. Contactless deliveries and takeaways will still be allowed. People should work from home if possible. Any kind of public gathering is banned, except for weddings and funerals, which can have up to 10 people in attendance. Travelling to the city is banned unless you live there. Auckland contains 1/3 of NZ’s total population and is the business hub of the country.

The rest of the country is going to level 2. That’s where basic precautions are put in place, such as two-metre social distancing. Gatherings of more than 100 people are not allowed. You can read about the differences of alert levels [here](https://covid19.govt.nz/covid-19/restrictions/alert-system-overview/).

Thousands of them come to my feeder. They drink nectar here in the desert where I live because there are not enough flowers to feed on, not enough water to keep them alive.

Hi, not sure if you'd see my chat message but wanted to message you about bees.

I saw your bee feeding advice. I hope you've read my reply to you but I'll paraphrase here in case you missed it.

Your heart is in the right place, and I'm delighted you care about  helping the bees, but I'm afraid what you're doing isn't good for them.  When they come for your sugar water, they think they've found nectar  jackpot, that's why they keep coming. But, unfortunately sugar water  isn't actually good for them at all. Just gives them basic energy and  nothing else, but the bees don't know this and will actually prioritise  your empty sugar water over flowers.

The reason you see so many is because one bee went back and said to  the hive ""guys, I found an amazing, abundant and easy food source, let's  go!"" But the bees don't realise that the sugar water is just junk food.

Not getting the nutrients they need makes them weaker and more  susceptible to diseases and the time they spent feeding at yours would  be better spent foraging for actual food.

Sugar water should only be used to revive an exhausted bee. If you  want to actually feed them, plant bee friendly flowers instead.

If you see this, it might be a good idea to edit your top level  comment with a disclaimer, as we really need to spread this information  around, for the sake of the bees.",1048,"Meanwhile Canadian bee keepers in the prairies are calling for the federal government to reverse its potential ban of neo-nic seed treatments due to a concert that farmers will use pyrethroids as an alternative insecticide.

What's with the menorah in the photo?",5477,"While this is a good thing, it is important to note that the ICC is not denouncing him, nor is any court in the Hague. These allegations are being brought by a non-state actor to the ICC.


The good news is that if this prompts the Prosector at the ICC to commence an investigation, the ICC has recently found that neither *rationae personae* immunity nor *rationae materiae* immunity protect from ICC jurisdiction. The former of these immunities protects against the enforcement jurisdiction of any country when the person is sitting as a head of state, head of government, or foreign minister. The latter protects against the enforcement jurisdiction of any other state for actions done at any point during the political position. 

Article 27 of the Rome Statute states:

> This Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular, official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.

> Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person.


As treaty ranks above customary international law (where these particular immunities come from), this should mean that leaders of parties to the Rome Statute are not able to invoke their immunities. However, the ICC functions through the enforcement of other states. Basically what this means, is that other states must arrest alleged criminals and extradite them to the Hague. The concept of the aforementioned immunities as regards the ICC has therefore been split into vertical immunity (i.e. immunity before the court) and horizontal immunity (i.e. immunity to other states).

It has long been suggested that horizontal immunity bars states from arresting heads of state due to rationae personae immunity, even in the face of an ICC arrest warrant. This is generally due to the original wording of the Rome Statute which stated:

> Any immunities or special procedural rules attached to the official capacity of a person, whether under national or international law, may not be relied upon to prevent the Court from exercising its jurisdiction in relation to that person.’

Note the removal of the word ""any"" in the modern-day treaty. This suggests to most states, and in fact scholars (see Professor Dapo Akande's excellent 2018 article in ECIJ about this) that horizontal rationae personae immunity was specifically written in the modern day treaty to not be waived by this provision.

However, in paragraph 120 of a very controversial decision by the ICC's appellate body in 2019 called *The Prosecutor v. Omar Hassan Ahmad Al-Bashir* the court stated:

> The Pre-Trial Chamber found that the effect of article 27(2) of the Statute on States Parties of the Rome Statute is two-fold: it prevents them from invoking any immunity belonging to them under international law (i) ‘as a ground for refusing arrest and surrender of a person sought by the Court (vertical effect)’; and (ii) ‘when cooperation in the arrest and surrender of a person to the Court is provided by another State Party (horizontal effect)’.341 While the Appeals Chamber, for the reasons set out above, disagrees with the Pre-Trial Chamber’s finding as to the existence of immunity vis-à-vis this Court, it confirms the correctness of the Pre-Trial Chamber’s interpretation of article 27(2) of the Statute.


**THEREFORE AND TL;DR** if none of these immunities apply, as the ICC has stated they don't for parties to the Rome Statute, and he is found guilty (which would require proof he purposely intended to exterminate a group), Bolsonaro will never be able to enter any state party to the Rome Statute, and any of his accounts may be frozen by the same. Contrary to comments here suggesting that this isn't something he will care about, most politicians do care about ICC indictments. They are quite powerful.


Further and most importantly, Brazil itself has a quazi-monist constitution. This means that some international law is internalized within Brazil. If this is held to be the case, then it could open a unique cause of action again Bolsonaro within Brazil after Bolsonaro is no longer president. (Take that to the people who doubt the ability of international law)


**Edit for how the non-state actor may turn its claim into a real investigation**


There are three ways that the ICC can commence an investigation.

1.  A matter can be referred to the ICC by a state party

2. A matter can be referred to the ICC by the United Nations Security Council

3. A matter can be taken up by the ICC prosecutor on their own initiative.



This current action is being led to convince the prosecutor to act. A prosecutor may take up such investigation under the following in Article 15 of the Rome Statute:


> 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations *proprio motu*  on the basis of information on crimes within the
jurisdiction of the Court.

> 2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received. For this purpose, he or she
may seek additional information from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental or nongovernmental organizations, or other reliable sources that he or she deems appropriate, and may receive
written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court.

> 3. If the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, he or she
shall submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request for authorization of an investigation, together with any
supporting material collected. Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance
with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 


*Proprio motu* basically means ""on their own initiative."" So the prosecutor may assess at any time whether a crime has been committed and whether it is within the jurisdiction of the ICC. If it is then they may commence an investigation. However, also according to the Rome Statute, admissibility is governed under Article 17:


> Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is
inadmissible where:


> (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State
is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;

> (b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not
to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of
the State genuinely to prosecute;

> (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and
a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;

> (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court


So if it has been investigated by its own court, it is not admissible to the ICC. However, the ICC does have jurisdiction, even where the country has ""investigated"" if it has only done so as a show to avoid ICC jurisdiction, this investigation will not be valid. So essentially, if the ICC determines that Bolsonaro must be investigated, a true investigation must be commenced either domestically in Brazil or by the ICC Prosecutor.


There is also a final hurdle that must be passed as pointed out in other comments. There must be actual substance to the complaint. I have not seen the any formal complaint and do not have the evidence in front of me to vouch for whether he will be found guilty let alone investigated. Though at the current moment, based on the unwillingness of the Prosecutor to proceed up to this point it seems unlikely.


**Edit 2 for ""what if Brazil just removes itself from the ICC""**


Unfortunately it could do that and avoid punishment under international law. *However,* there is apparently a quiet internal constitutional debate in Brazil as to whether the President has the outright ability to terminate a treaty if congress does not approve and vice-versa. A president terminating a treaty for fear of a finding of genocide against them may be cause to revisit that questions.

Nonetheless, assuming he does have that power, jurisdiction for actions under the *Rome Statute* must be in accordance with Article 12 which states that in order for there to be ICC jurisdiction, the action must have taken place on the territory of a state party to the *Rome Statute*, or the crime committed by a national of a party to the *Rome Statute*. However, it is debatable whether this could be done after an investigation is initiated and about to come to a verdict. Further, it would be an outright admission by Bolsonaro that he is likely to be convicted in the Hague for genocide, which makes the timing of a withdrawal unlikely as the political consequences of such an admission would be quite steep.",3095,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,neu
