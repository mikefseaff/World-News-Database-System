thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/wp1fvdxxwb45/)**\\n\\nOver 100 news agencies sitting in 100 contries all over the world are disclosing the panama papers tonight at the exact same time. This will be a huge hit for several large figures in world sports, politics and economy. Names like Lionel messi, Vladimir Putin and the prime minister of Iceland are already leaked. I am curious to see who turns up as well. What a leak!! All coordinated by German newspaper namely the Sueddeutsche Zeitung. As op linked to\\n\\nBefore reading further: \\nHere is a nice ELI5 of shell company procedures and how they work written by /u/Jaredlong:\\n\\n>Taxes sure do suck, right? Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didn\\'t pay them. Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to ncrease spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can \"spend\" that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden.\\n\\n*pls note that this is a subjective ELI5 and there are indeed some reasons/scenarios where shell companies operate for legit reasons! (thanks /u/Toppo) [orig. comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4d75i7/26_terabyte_leak_of_panamanian_shell_company_data/d1og7kz)*\\n\\nEdit: \\'Die Zeit\\' another big German newspaper writes that about 200k  letterbox companies (in total 11.5 million records) are disclosed... Jesus what is going on. This will be big news for the next few weeks (hopefully longer than that!)\\n\\nEdit2: the icij had released a YouTube video [here:](https://youtu.be/F6XnH_OnpO0) which sums up what is in those documents.

There is research done on social media during these disease outbreaks (2009 pandemic) so comments might be used in a study that influences public health policy. \\n\\n\\nFor questions, please visit the askscience [megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/etkdx1/coronavirus_megathread/). *There\\'s no such thing as a stupid question, just a stupid answer.* Please *do* ask if you\\'re worried or unsure.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n**What do you need to know?**\\n\\n\\nAs of 23:59 Jan 29, there are officially:\\n\\n\\n**7711** confirmed cases in China across **31** provinces\\n\\n\\n**5794** suspected cases. **81947**/88693 are under medical observation\\n\\n\\n**170** deaths and **1370** are severe cases. 162/170 deaths occurred in Hubei province (where Wuhan is). The rest are within various provinces in China\\n\\n\\n* 17 deaths range from 48-89 years old. **14/17** deaths are of the elderly above 65 years old. Most have pre-existing conditions that seem to predispose to a more severe disease presentation. People who are already sick prior to infection may be more at risk due to decreased immunity. Some of these people had hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. Death was typically the result of severe respiratory failure but includes others like multi-organ failure. Info on some of the remaining deaths is currently unknown\\n\\n* Healthy people have died\\n\\n* 124 people **recovered**\\n\\n**90** exported cases: Thailand (14), Japan (11), Hong Kong/Singapore (10), Taiwan (8), Macao/Australia/Malaysia (7 each), USA/France (5 each), Germany/South Korea/UAE (4 each), Canada (3), Vietnam (2), Nepal/Cambodia/Finland/Sri Lanka (1 each)\\n\\n#Please refer to the live trackers for the most up-date statistics\\n\\n**Initial symptoms**\\n\\n* cough\\n* fever (pyrexia possible absence in young individuals)\\n* fatigue, discomfort (malaise), shortness of breath (dyspnea), dizziness, chest tightness, headache, muscle aches, chills, sore throat\\n* possible atypical presentations in immunosuppressed/elderly\\n\\n**Treatment**\\n\\nNo cure, care is supportive to relieve symptoms.

We\\'re targeting this for drugs. Existing compounds are already being tested in China for treatment\\n\\n* Use of masks alone is insufficient to prevent infection. It can worsen problems if people believe all you need is a mask. More hygiene measures are needed: wash hands, sneeze/coughing into a disposable tissue, maintain distance of >1 m: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-health-care-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak\\n\\n* Incubation period for the first 425 patients was 5.2 days. R0 differs by study. If R0 > 1, the epidemic will increase. We aim to reduce this number to < 1. **R0 = 2.2** so on average, each patient will infect 2.2 other people. Other factors play into this, like immunity\\n\\n* Of the first 425 patients: 240 (56%) were male. **No** cases for children under age 15. **84** cases for ages 15-44. **179** cases between ages 45-64. **162** cases for age 65 and over. Incubation period for the first 425 patients was 5.2 days. Nearly **half** of cases occurred people over age 60. It\\'s possible that children *are* infected but show milder symptoms. In the coming weeks, once developed, a seroprevalence study (where we test your blood serum) will give us a much better idea.\\n\\n* What we\\'re monitoring is whether exportation of cases in other countries can sustain transmission. This is crucial leading up to a pandemic. Circulation within the community is bad news. It\\'s why surveillance, isolation, and why close contacts are being monitored.\\n\\n* China does deserve some credit. If you compare the timeline with the SARS outbreak, we are doing **way** better (availability of data, transparency, measures of control, research). China hid reports of SARS and took 4 months to report to the WHO. It took **5 months to even identify** it was a coronavirus and sequence the genome. We had a genome to analyze in lab within 11 days of their announcement to WHO. I remember laying in bed and jumping up when I was notified that the complete genome was available, pretty excited\\n\\n* I also want to stress that it is quite easy to sit behind a screen and throw blame around. Granted there are certain contributing factors leading to this outbreak but in my opinion, there is a time to address those. At the moment, there needs to be a focus on containment and research. If you\\'re outside of China and worried about it, consider how it would feel to be **in** China.

Due to its size, health and age diversity — with sequoias ranging from seedlings to Methuselahs — this grove represents \"the most consequential giant sequoia conservation project of our lifetime,\" according to the group\\'s president.\\n\\nKnown as\\xa0Alder Creek, the grove covers a seemingly modest 530 acres (2 square kilometers), but that\\'s a big deal for giant sequoias. The iconic trees once lived throughout the Northern Hemisphere, but they now exist in only 73 isolated groves, all located on the western slopes of California\\'s Sierra Nevada mountains. This particular grove packs a lot into its 530 acres, including 483 sequoias with trunks at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter, along with a few hundred smaller sequoias of varying ages.\\n\\nThat age range is a big reason why this grove is so valuable, according to Sam Hodder, president and CEO of Save the Redwoods League (SRL), a century-old California nonprofit that\\'s been working to acquire Alder Creek for more than 20 years.\\n\\n**\"Many giant sequoia groves are just a single age class, usually in the thousands,\" Hodder told MNN when the deal was announced in September 2019. \"In this one, a real indication of its health and resilience is that there are giant sequoia of all age ranges.\" While any remaining giant sequoia grove is a rarity, he adds, \"it\\'s rarer still to have multiple age classes, and such a healthy forest ecosystem.\"**\\n\\nSRL signed a purchase agreement with the Rouch family, which has owned the grove since the 1940s. That was a big step after two decades, but the sale wasn\\'t official — until now. There was the small matter of $15.65 million, which SRL had to raise by Dec. 31 before it could take ownership. The group did that with a public\\xa0fundraising drive\\xa0on its website that rallied for help right up to the deadline. Donations rolled in from more than 8,500 donors from all 50 states and around the world.\\n\\n\\nAlder Creek is an island of private property surrounded by Giant Sequoia National Monument, which spans about 328,000 acres (1,327 square km) and connects to the even larger Sequoia National Forest. The Rouch family has long used the grove for commercial logging, Hodder says, and even cut down giant sequoias in the early days, although since the 1960s they\\'ve reportedly only logged non-sequoia species like sugar pine and white fir. SRL plans to eventually transfer ownership to the U.S. Forest Service, so the sequoias can join the federally protected wilderness around them.\\n\\nThat won\\'t happen for a while, though, since SRL expects to hold the property for five to 10 years. That\\'s partly because this kind of public-acquisition process moves slowly, Hodder says, but also because SRL wants time to study the grove and implement a plan for good stewardship, making sure the trees are healthy and ready before handing them over to the public.\\n\\nAs part of that preparation, the group plans to open Alder Creek for public access even before giving it to the Forest Service, hoping to help the ecosystem ease into an unfamiliar role as a host for human visitors. \"This property has been in private ownership, and it has never had public access,\" Hodder says. \"We want to go through a thoughtful process to plan out public access, so when it does get conveyed into the national monument, it\\'s ready for its public purpose.\"\" - article excerpt', 3135, '[removed]', 2711)\n","('t3_fdi90i', 'Aldi tells suppliers product packaging must be 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025', 'https://www.enviro30.com/post/aldi-tells-suppliers-product-packaging-must-be-100-recyclable-reusable-or-compostable-by-2025', 'enviro30.com', datetime.datetime(2020, 3, 4, 11, 28, 4), 64, 64, 64, 2525, 124179, 0, 64, 64, Decimal('0.0000'), Decimal('1.0000'), Decimal('0.0000'), Decimal('0.0000'), 'neu', 64, 'Yet another reason to shop at Aldi', 11354, 'And if they could use a bare minimum that would be good too.  90% of my garbage disposal is packaging.', 3596, 'I don’t want friends I want Aldi’s', 3018)\n","('t3_fgzvgq', 'World Health Organization declares the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/who-declares-the-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-pandemic.html', 'cnbc.com', datetime.datetime(2020, 3, 11, 9, 28, 59), 98, 98, 98, 9525, 116090, 0, 98, 98, Decimal('0.0000'), Decimal('1.0000'), Decimal('0.0000'), Decimal('0.0000'), 'neu', 98, 'So what exactly is this going to mean in terms of governmental responses and changes to day to day life?', 15714, \"About damn time.\\n\\nFor those asking what it means, it doesn't mean anything in a legal sense but the designation to pandemic basically tells every country in the world to start rolling out higher-level, emergency-grade response plans (if they haven't started).\\n\\nBasically, get your shit together if you haven't already.\", 10755, 'wonder what this means for airlines and people wanting to cancel flights.', 8916)\n","('t3_fhhyot', 'Brazilian spokesperson tests positive for COVID-19 after he meets with Trump and Pence at Mar-a-Lago', 'https://www.rawstory.com/2020/03/brazilian-spokesperson-tests-positive-for-covid-19-after-he-meets-with-trump-and-pence-at-mar-a-lago/', 'rawstory.com', datetime.datetime(2020, 3, 12, 8, 21, 41), 83, 83, 83, 9312, 118747, 0, 83, 83, Decimal('0.0000'), Decimal('0.7950'), Decimal('0.2050'), Decimal('0.5574'), 'pos', 83, '[deleted]', 8082, '[removed]', 17269, 'Wait you guys put both the POTUS and the VPOTUS in the same place, meeting the same group of people during a potentially lethal viral pandemic?', 14271)\n","('t3_fhmpsi', 'Coronavirus Vaccine Made In Saskatchewan Canada Is Now In The Testing Stages', 'https://www.narcity.com/news/ca/sk/coronavirus-vaccine-made-in-saskatchewan-is-now-in-the-testing-stages', 'narcity.com', datetime.datetime(2020, 3, 12, 13, 12, 25), 41, 41, 41, 6284, 131091, 0, 41, 41, Decimal('0.0000'), Decimal('1.0000'), Decimal('0.0000'), Decimal('0.0000'), 'neu', 41, 'Within hours of hockey season being postponed.\\n\\nCanada:We have a vaccine in the testing stages right now.', 40516, 'COVID-19 cancels hockey.

Overdue.', 6940, 'So, there are questions in this thread and in others about why this genocide was recognized so late and why other similar genocides have yet to be recognized by the United States. As a lawyer working in international law, I wrote what I hope to be at least a partial answer. Unfortunately, the history is fairly complicated and generally poorly explained by news articles. **TL;DR**: The answer is two-fold, and explains why all countries are hesitant to declare certain actions genocide even within countries otherwise unimportant to their foreign policy. First, a declaration of genocide obliges the declarant to act to stop the genocide. Second, and most remarkable in the current case, the declaration forever helps define what the declaring country considers genocide.\\n\\n\\nIn any case, and for the record, this declaration reflects the settled legal reality that this genocide absolutely and legally was a genocide.\\n\\n\\n***First: The Erga Omnes Obligation***\\n\\n\\nTo understand the first prong, it is necessary to understand the legal concept of *erga omnes*. An *erga omnes* obligation is an obligation that all countries owe to each other and to the world, and is a label generally ascribed to the most important obligations (called *jus cogens*) which the prevention of genocide is. It gives any country in the world standing in an international court when a violation of an *erga omnes* obligation occurs and another country does not stop it. It therefore gives all states the rights to invoke state responsibility for the other country’s failure to contain the genocide (very basically, state responsibility is similar to paying damages, *see* the ILC’s report on state responsibility, linked below). This means that states that do not perform their *erga omnes* obligation when it is their universal responsibility to do so open themselves up to claims internationally. *Erga Omnes* obligations were recognized by the International Court of Justice in [*Barcelona Traction*](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/50/050-19700205-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf) at para 33:\\n\\n\\n> When a State admits into its territory foreign investments or foreign nationals, whether natural or juristic persons, it is bound to extend to them the protection of the law and assumes obligations concerning the treatment to be afforded them. These obligations, however, are neither absolute nor unqualified. In particular, an essential distinction should be drawn between the obligations of a State towards the international community as a whole, and those arising vis-à-vis another State in the field of diplomatic protection. By their very nature the former are the concern of all States. In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection; they are obligations *erga omnes*.\\n\\n\\nThe prevention of genocide as *erga omnes* was recognized by the International Law Commission of the United Nations through it’s [*Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries*](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf) at page 111 where it states:\\n\\n\\n> essential distinction should be drawn between the obligations of a State towards the international community as a whole, and those arising vis-à-vis another State in the field of diplomatic protection. By their very nature the former are the concern of all States. In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection; they are obligations erga omnes…  At the preliminary objections stage of the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide case, it stated that “the rights and obligations enshrined by the [Genocide] Convention are rights and obligations erga omnes” this finding contributed to its conclusion that its temporal jurisdiction over the claim was not limited to the time after which the parties became bound by the Convention.\\n\\n\\nThe idea that genocide is an obligation *erga omnes* formally brought into law in the 1996 [*Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia*](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/91/091-19960711-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf) PMO decision when the court, through an analysis of the purpose of the *Genocide Convention* found the prevention of genocide to be an obligation *erga omnes*. That said, in paragraph 31, it said something very interesting: \\n\\n\\n> \"The origins of the Convention show that it was the intention of the United Nations to condemn and punish genocide as \\'a crime under international law\\' involving a denial of the right of existence of entire human groups, a denial which shocks the conscience of mankind and results in great losses to humanity, and which is contrary to moral law and to the spirit and aims of the United Nations. The first consequence arising from this conception is that the principles underlying the Convention are principles which are recognized by civilized nations as binding on States, even without any conventional obligation. A second consequence is the universal character both of the condemnation of genocide and of the CO-operation required \\'in order to liberate mankind from such an odious scourge\\' (Preamble to the Convention).\" It follows that the rights and obligations enshrined by the Convention are rights and obligations erga omnes. ***The Court notes that the obligation each State thus has to prevent and to punish the crime of genocide is not territorially limited by the Convention.*** [emphasis added]\\n\\n\\nThis was made even more explicit in the [*The Gambia v. Myanmar*](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/178/178-20200123-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf) where the court said at para 41:\\n\\n\\n> The Court held that these provisions generated “obligations [which] may be defined as ‘obligations erga omnes partes’ in the sense that each State party has an interest in compliance with them in any given case” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (II), p. 449, para. 68). It follows that any State party to the Genocide Convention, and not only a specially affected State, **may invoke the responsibility of another State party with a view to ascertaining the alleged failure to  comply with its obligations erga omnes partes, and to bring that failure to an end.** [emphasis added]\\n\\n\\nThe parts that I have emphasized are a formal recognition that each state has an actual obligation to do something to prevent genocide in the case that an occurrence of e genocide exists, and as it is an *erga omnes* obligation, a state that recognizes a genocide, is in a position to help stop that genocide, but refuses to do so, has breached its *erga omnes* obligations and other states may invoke state responsibility over them for their failure to act. That is one of a few major reasons that states are hesitant to recognize genocides; **they may be bound to act to stop that genocide if they so declare one.**\\n\\n\\n***Second: the Application of the Genocide Convention***\\n\\n\\nOne of the most important instruments in international law is the [*Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties*](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf). This treaty under Article 31(3)(b) on the general principles of interpretation states: \\n\\n\\n> 3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context: (b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation\\n\\n\\nThe [*Genocide Convention*](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf) under Article II states: \\n\\n\\n> In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:\\n> (a) Killing members of the group;\\n> (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;\\n> (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;\\n> (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;\\n> (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\\n\\nThe essence of these clauses is that the treatment of Genocide under the Genocide Convention compounds in on itself. While genocide is defined, there is not currently a list of actual specific actions undertaken by states that constitute genocide, which would be extremely helpful because according to the article you have to prove that the there was *intent* to destroy the group, which is based on actions and statements (there are many cases that speak to this requirement).\\n\\n\\nIf the global community generally considers something to be genocide, then that thing that it considers genocide will gradually become indicative of the crime of genocide. Thus, countries risk creating legal situation where genocide becomes what they have declared it to be. While that sounds great, it also risks having the crime of genocide become meaningless as countries are willing to declare it whenever they suspect it, and thus gradually bring the net of behaviour that the genocide convention catches wider. The reason that this is a bad thing is that, as mentioned genocide’s *erga omnes* status is extremely serious and obliges states to act. A loose genocide definition actually makes the world *less* stable and makes states *worse* at preventing that genocide as genocide begins to mean less. Again, this comment is **not** meant to defend any country that shrinks away from its responsibilities.\\n\\n\\nIn sum, international law makes the declaration of genocide a lot harder than base concerns about diplomacy (which absolutely still exist) and is actually much more complicated than people realize.', 3916)\n","('t3_os26dl', 'The Philippines Wins Its First-Ever Olympic Gold, After Nearly 100 Years Of Trying', 'https://www.npr.org/sections/tokyo-olympics-live-updates/2021/07/26/1020710023/the-philippines-wins-its-first-ever-olympic-gold-after-nearly-100-years-of-tryin', 'npr.org', datetime.datetime(2021, 7, 26, 9, 21, 56), 50, 50, 50, 2506, 127706, 0, 50, 50, Decimal('0.0000'), Decimal('0.7640'), Decimal('0.2360'), Decimal('0.5719'), 'pos', 50, 'And she beat the world record holder (Liao) to do it--well done Hidilyn!', 10183, 'The most amazing thing about her story is that she got stuck in Malaysia during the COVID lockdown.
